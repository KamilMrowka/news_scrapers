For those hitting the polls ahead of the Nov. 5 election, there will be three non-binding advisory questions they'll be asked to vote \"yes\" or \"no\" to.\n\nThe following three questions will appear on Illinois voters' ballots this election season:\n\nBut, what is a non-binding advisory question? And what could your vote mean for the future of the state?\n\n\"An advisory question is a ballot measure that is used to gauge public opinion on a certain issue or policy. They have no legal or binding effect on state law or the constitution, and are the only kinds of statewide ballot measures to have no actual legal effect if they pass or fail,\" said Nicole Fisher, a staff writer for ballotpedia. \"They are placed on the ballot by the state legislature in order to see the public opinion on an issue, and can use the election results to determine whether or not to pass or implement certain pieces of legislation.\"\n\nIn the U.S., 12 other states \"provide a mechanism to place advisory questions on the ballot,\" Fisher said. Those states are: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont and Wisconsin. \n\nRhode Island and Washington used to allow for advisory questions on the ballot, but those laws have since been repealed, she added. \n\nShe said it's not very common to have ballot measures at the statewide level, and the last time three advisory questions appear on the ballot in Illinois — which is the maximum number that can appear during an election —was 2014.\n\nDuring that election, voters were asked about increasing the minimum wage to $10, requiring prescription birth control to be covered in prescription drug coverage health insurance plans and increasing the tax on income greater than one million dollars to provide for additional revenue to schools.\n\n All three of the questions were approved by voters. \n\nThis year's ballot measures were proposed by the Illinois State Senate. Democratic State Sen. Don Harmon and democratic state Rep. Jay Hoffman sponsored Senate Bill 2412, which placed these three questions on the ballot. \n\nIn addition to the advisory questions, SB 2412 also blocked established political party committees from putting candidates on the general election ballot if they do not go through the primary process, Fisher said. \n\nThe advisory questions needed a majority vote \n\n session this past year to make it onto ballots statewide, which amounts to a minimum of 60 votes in the Illinois House of Representatives and 30 votes in the Illinois State Senate. The questions also require the governor's signature. \n\nSB 2412 passed the Illinois House of Representatives by 67-4 on May 1, with 67 democrats voting for the bill, four Democrats voting against it and 39 republicans and four democrats not voting on the measure, Fisher said. \n\nThe bill then passed the Illinois State Senate by 35-3 on May 2, with 35 democrats voting for the bill and 3 Democrats voting against it, while 19 republicans and 1 democrat did not vote, Fisher said. \n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker signed off on the ballot measures on May 3.\n\nFisher said for those interested in historical ballot measure information in Illinois can visit ballotpedia's page \n\n, which includes information on election years dating to 1877. For more information on what is on your ballot this November, voters can use \n\n to view their specific ballot.\n\nHere's what you need to know if you will be among those heading to the polls.\n\n"},

The pub could open as early as November.\n\n\"We want McGonagle’s to be your go-to for all things friends and family, a proper neighborhood Irish Pub. An impromptu meal two or three times a week, a special occasion such as a rehearsal dinner, birthdays, anniversaries, and more,\" said owner Oran McGonagle. \"We want to be the go-to place for the neighborhood, we’ve got the space. Whether you’re dining solo or pulling up with a group, we’ve got you.\"\n\nMcGonagle's will also offer music and entertainment on a live music stage. Officials said they hope to bring in talent from the Boston area, but also nationally recognized acts from the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nThe pub will also be a home for sports fans, as ownership said they'll have two 20-foot projector screens that will show local sports teams as well as English Premier League bouts, rugby and more.\n\nOpening day will come after completion of a \"million dollar\" construction project. \n\nWe put a lot of effort into creating an authentic Irish bar experience which meant stripping everything down and starting again,\" said McGonagle. \n\nThe first floor will consist of a classic neighborhood Irish pub and the lower level will feature a large bar and restaurant with the stage for live music and space for dancing. \n\nAs for the food program, expect Irish classics from shepherd's pie to fish and chips, as well as a \"traditional\" Sunday lunch. For the weekend, McGonagle's will feature a brunch menu featuring a classic Irish breakfast.\n\nThe lunch menu will also feature some unique, popular dishes in Ireland such as the “spiced bag”, a dish made famous by local Chinese restaurants, which includes deep-fried salt and chili chips, salt and chili chicken red and green peppers, sliced chili peppers and fried onions with a variety of spices.\n\nMcGonagle said he'll also take inspiration from his brother, who owns Mani Pizza in Ireland, by putting a selection of crispy bread flour pizzas made in a wood-burning oven on the menu.\n\nThe beverage program will be supervised by bar manager Deirdre Doherty, who hails from Donegal, Ireland but now lives just down the road from McGonagle’s. \n\nThe new pub claims to be the first bar on the East Coast, and maybe the first in the U.S., to have installed \"proper Guinness draft lines which are used on installs in Ireland.\"\n\nThe line will have its own glycol chiller separate to the beer lines which will allow the team to set the Guinness temperature separately, ownership said. \n\n\"After studying beer line installation in Ireland and working with Guinness USA we decided to install our beer lines to match the Irish standards. In Ireland, a Guinness is poured with a ½ inch beer line while in the USA they use ¼ inch beer lines. The thicker lines will help perfect the flow of gas and pressure to the glass. We have also changed our gas mix for our regular beers which will be similar to Irish standards,\" said McGonagle. \n\nMcGonagle’s also features a whiskey club where customers will be able to have their own whiskey locker. Customers will be able to purchase sought-after whiskeys from around the world and will have access to them when they visit the pub. \n\n“Whiskeys are very popular these days and sometimes it’s hard to find the ones you like at certain bars. We will offer customers the chance to stop in with friends and have a drink out of their very own bottle,\" said McGonagle. \n\nOnce opened, the pub will be open Monday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. The space will seat 235 people.\n\n"},

The Certified Foods on Richards Street was remodeled into a facility to treat people overcoming substance abuse addictions.\n\nDuring an interview Thursday at City Hall, Joliet's new economic development director Paulina Martinez said it's her belief the new El Guero grocery store will be open for business during these next two weeks.\n\nThe city has not been notified of the actual first day of business, according to Martinez.\n\n\"I met with them last week, Priscilla Cordero and I,\" Martinez said, referring to the executive director of the Joliet City Center Partnership. \"We've been in communications with them, and they are in the process of hiring 50 to 60 staff members.\"\n\nMartinez said it's her understanding the long delay for El Guero's opening was caused because of the hiring process.\n\n\"Honestly, hiring can take time. They're almost there, which has been their biggest delay,\" Martinez said. \"They are targeting to open by the end of this month. It will be a soft launch. They just want to get open and do a soft launch now.\"\n\nMartinez believes that people on the city's east side will flock to the El Guero and use it regularly once it opens for business. It's been seven and a half years since the Certified Foods left.\n\n\"It's been empty for years,\" Martinez noted. \"I think whatever El Guero has done in terms of the beautification and the inside improvements to the store, it's something that's sorely needed on that site, and it will be for one less eyesore for the east side.\n\n\"I think it will have a draw. It's near Collins Street. It will be an enhancement to that.\"\n\nThe city of Joliet sales tax incentives rebate agreement with El Guero does not provide the Chicago area grocery store company with any funds until the grocery store is open. The only incentives the city has done so far is waiving of the building permits for the construction, Martinez noted.\n\nJoliet will mark the seventh grocery store for El Guero, according to Martinez. The company's closest location is the El Guero on Theodore Street, across from the old Crest Hill City Hall.\n\nMartinez expects the Joliet El Guero will feature a bakery and butcher shop. El Guero will offer a wide range of Latin American products. The city of Joliet has already approved a liquor license allowing El Guero to sell packaged liquor here.\n\n\"I think this is one of those projects to spur more development and investment in that area,\" Martinez said. \"And kind of set the standards for beautification.\"\n\n"},

Photos and videos of her in her distressed, injured state have circulated on social media, where some have come to dub her \"Floppy.\" Wildlife officials say the large bone lodged in her mouth is likely preventing the deer from eating or drinking. \n\nWithout human help, her chances of survival are likely dwindling.\n\nConcerned residents alerted officials, prompting a biologist from the state Department of Fish and Wildlife to spend several days earlier this week searching for the deer at the reservoir. \n\n\"This is the first time I've ever seen anything like this,\" the biologist, Kevin Howells, \n\n \"She's wounded. She's injured. She feels vulnerable. She's malnourished.\"\n\nThe operation included locking the fence around the reservoir as Howells hoped to immobilize the doe with a tranquilizer dart in order to remove the bone and provide her any necessary medical treatment.\n\n“She has what looks to be a femur bone lodged in her mouth and her throat,” Howells told \n\n“I saw her briefly yesterday afternoon.

He was airlifted in an air ambulance based in Pennsylvania, which was allowed to carry blood, when those in New York could not.\n\nNew York, officials said, was the last state in the nation to adopt the ability for helicopters to carry blood.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, Hochul passed new legislation allowing ambulance services and advanced life support first response services to store and distribute blood and initiate and administer blood transfusions.\n\nUniformed EMTs, Paramedics & Inspectors-FDNY President Oren Barzilay said, of that measure: \"Giving us the ability to carry whole blood on many of our ambulances and do transfusions in the field has been proven to save lives when seconds count.\"\n\nHoward Waldman, who has served for decades as a volunteer firefighter and a member of the North Fork Volunteer Firefighters Association — the oldest firematic organization on the North Fork, encompassing Riverhead and Southold towns — is sounding the cry in Suffolk County for whole blood to be administered pre-hospital.\n\n \"We're talking about making a difference in trauma victims all across Suffolk County,\" he said.\n\nWhole blood transfusions in the field have led to success stories nationwide, he added: One woman lost her leg in a motorcycle accident but was saved, he said. \"She was bleeding out. She never would have made it to surgery,\" Waldman said.\n\nHis son, Cameron Waldman, an attending physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine with the Albany Med Health System, also discussed the successes, including one fire chief's young daughter in Florida who survived due to whole blood administered at the scene.\n\nDespite the benefits, only about 1 percent of the country is utilizing whole blood out in the field, Waldman said, adding that if it were more widely embraced, tens of thousands of lives could be saved.\n\nAccording to a post by NBC, currently, 99 percent of rescue operations nationwide \n\n with blood — meaning thousands bleed out each year from injuries they might have survived, according to those in the medical field.\n\nCameron Waldman came to Long Island recently to plead for action with his father; both spoke before the Suffolk County legislature to try and garner support for the life-saving mission.\n\nCameron told Patch that while there have been logistical hurdles to overcome, including how to maintain blood temperatures and adhere to blood standard regulations, the measure, \"Makes sense. From our experience, it has been a really, really good intervention to have in a pre-hospital setting. I have seen it save lives.\"\n\nThrough his work in Albany, where emergency responders must travel long distances to reach trauma centers, Waldman said the ability to utilize whole blood at the scene has been invaluable.\n\n\"We've all seen firsthand how it has definitely helped patients in the field. One patient, who was involved in a really bad motor vehicle accident, came to us after having gotten blood in the field. It was definitely a situation where if the patient hadn't gotten that blood, they would likely have died before they got to us.\"\n\nHe added: \"Medical intervention in a trauma situation can be complicated but in some ways, it's simple: If you have low blood pressure and are unstable due to trauma, the intervention is to get blood as soon as possible. These patients in trauma settings need blood, quickly. It just makes sense that intervention happen in a pre-hospital setting.\"\n\nCameron Waldman said two of his colleagues, Luke Duncan, an emergency and critical care physcian an Albany Medical Center, and Mike Dailey in Albany, have also been advocates for seeing the whole blood on rescue helicopters.\n\n\"Patients with blood loss need blood — not saline or salt water,\" Dailey said. \"Blood is life-saving therapy for our trauma patients.\"\n\nHe added: \"We must find ways to work together across a county or a region to assure that our patients can get the blood they need, but we protect the rare resource at the same time. Every EMS agency agency cannot carry blood — it must be a collaborative effort directed by the EMS physician leadership of the trauma centers.\"\n\nAnd, said Dailey, blood donation at every opportunity is critical to ensure the resource for patients is available.\n\n\"The keys to this are collaboration, oversight, and assuring no waste of the blood. There are great models out there to emulate,\" Dailey said.\n\nDuncan added that in the upstate region, where there is a \"huge amount of ground to cover\" for emergency responders trying to reach a trauma center, having blood at the scene makes all the difference.\n\nHe agreed that patients need blood, not fluids, in a trauma situation, because blood carries oxygen. \n\nThose who receive blood in ambulances or on emergency aircraft see improved outcomes, he said.\n\nBut New York, which saw the ability to adminster blood in the field green-lighted far behind other states, has to catch up, and there are regulations that make it often a \"huge lift,\" he said. In his area, while the ability for paramedics in ambulances to administer whole blood transfusions has been approved by Hochul, the actual implementation still needs to be rolled out in many instances, he said.\n\n\"We have to figure out how to operationalize it,\" he said. \"There are plenty of systems that exist, we just have to do it.\"\n\nWhat needs to take place, he said, is the training of thousands of paramedics, as well as efforts to ensure blood is not wasted and is folded back into the blood supply if not used, within the 28 days of its shelf life. Also, Duncan said, there is a need for blood sharing agreements, and other \"big system issues\" that need to be navigated.\n\nBut the end results are life-changing, he said. \"Getting patients blood actually improves their outcomes,\" he agreed.\n\nCameron Waldman said coordination with private entities, as well as blood banks, EMS, hospitals and others is key. \"A good amount of coordination has to happen between several different agencies for a pre-hospital blood program to be successful,\" he said, adding that training an EMS crew is also critical.\n\n\"In the places that it’s been rolled out it, it just seems like the solution — where you are actually having results and saving lives. In the world of medicine interventions, those that are simple and work — those are the ones we really, really love.\"\n\nHe added: \"I know there are logistical issues and understand that, but the motivation to get it done is important. This is one intervention that saves lives. In a trauma situation, from a medical standpoint, you need, blood, blood, blood.\"\n\nOn Long Island, Howard Waldman and his son appeared before the Suffolk County Legislature in recent months to plead for change.\n\nBut, so far, Suffolk County is still weighing the decision, with both Stony Brook Medicine and Suffolk County Police necessary in a collaborative effort to see the vision become reality.\n\nStony Brook Medicine officials spoke to Patch: \"As a leading integrated healthcare system, Stony Brook Medicine is committed to working with organizations to provide the highest level of patient care to address the health needs of the Long Island population that it serves. As a Level I Trauma Center, we applaud the New York State legislative decision to provide pre-hospital blood. We await regional discussion, approval and guidance from Suffolk County. With this in mind, our healthcare system and Stony Brook University Hospital's blood bank have begun to develop a review of an internal process to evaluate carrying and administering blood pre-hospital and ensure supplies are readily available utilizing properly trained staff. \"\n\nSuffolk County Police said they were unable to respond.\n\nMichael Martino, communications director for Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine, told Patch: \"The county executive has always pledged to make Suffolk County safer and will provide law enforcement with all of the tools necessary to help them save lives.\"\n\nSuffolk County Legislator Dominick Thorne of District 7, the chair of the Suffolk County legislative committee of fire rescue and emergency services, outlined the steps needed before the idea of whole blood on rescue helicopters and ambulances could become a reality\n\n\"You would need the doctor that writes the prescriptions for EMS to write that prescription,\" he said.\n\nThorne agreed: \"Blood is the only thing that carries oxygen.\" IV fluid, which is given in trauma situations now, \"does not have the capability to carry oxygen.\"\n\nThorne said in areas such as Albany, where there is a great distance between only three trauma centers, the blood is critical; in Suffolk County, he said, there are several trauma centers scattered in close proximity to most trauama situations.\n\nHowever, he pointed out, in areas such as Fire Island or on the East End, \"it becomes tricky,\" just as it does in situations where there are prolonged extrication times. \"In those cases, at the end of the day, how are we going to keep them alive to cut them out of the vehicle? Those are the areas, and the cases, where it would be beneficial.\"\n\nThorne, who said he has 27 years of EMS history, added that he is \"imminently familiar with the needs and the risk benefit.\"\n\nNext steps would include having the measure cleared regionally through the Regional Emergency Medical Servicess Council. Once that happens, the next challenges would include handling the logistics of how the blood will be stored and the \"chain of custody of the blood.\"\n\nStony Brook Medicine already is a licensed emergency blood transfusion center, he said; the blood then would be transported to trauma scenes on Suffolk County police ambulances or medevec helicopters.\n\nBut blood temperature and storage must be considered, he said. \"This is not lidocaine or Narcan. You can't leave it in the box, it has to be specially stored at the right temperature.\"\n\nThorne added: \"The overall plan of having blood in a pre-hospital care environment is not a bad idea, when you get through all the logistics.\"\n\nHe also said that legislative approval on the county level is not needed; as New York State has already given the okay. \"We just have to decide regionally if it makes sense to us.\"\n\nThe only legislative action needed would be in authorizing the contract with the SCPD, which operates the helicopters, he said.\n\nAs it stands, Thorne said there is an \"ongoing conversation\" between Stony Brook Medicine, which supplies paramedics to Suffolk County Police headquarters, \"about whether it is or isn't beneficial. And secondly, what are the logistics that have to be worked out. I wouldn't not be in favor of this — I'm always in favor of more care than less.\"\n\nSuffolk County Legislator Catherine Stark, within whose district the North Fork Volunteer Firefighters Association operates, said she was moved by the testimony by both Waldman and his son. \"It sounds like an incredible, life-saving opportunity,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the idea was already under consideration by Stony Brook and SCPD.\n\nWhen the Waldmans spoke before the county legislature, Stark said she was moved. \"I would support it,\" she said. \"Several legislators all support this. I didn't see anybody that didn't support it.\"\n\nThe examples she heard about lives saved, she said, \"were really incredible stories\".\n\nStark added: \"Any effort that we can take to support local ambulances to save a life, to me, it's a no brainer.\"\n\n"},

The Select Board and School Committee did not request an override this past June, but Fox noted a general townwide override request of $4 million to $5 million is likely coming in the next year or two, which would not include the additional $7.6 million to fund the proposed teacher contract.\n\n\"To clearly state, as far as wages, we are still far, far apart,\" Fox said. \"There is still a gap that seems insurmountable from a funding standpoint. Quite frankly, it's a wager on services for our students that would be irresponsible at that level (of potential layoffs).\"\n\nThe School Committee is required to present a balanced budget with any override request — meaning the cuts would be in place pending the override vote late in June and would automatically take effect if the override vote failed.\n\nFox also noted that even if the override passed for the schools for one year there was no guarantee that town meeting members would appropriate the money back to the schools for the ensuing years of the proposed four-year (one-year and subsequent three-year) contract.\n\nSchool Committee Chair Jennifer Schaeffner said that she believed the sides had moved closer on parental leave, a proposed safety committee and other issues.\n\n\"We are committed to bargaining a contract that meets the needs of our students, our staff and our community,\" Schaeffner said. \"We have made progress. We absolutely have. We were far apart. We have come a little bit closer together. We are meeting again on Monday. We are meeting again the following Monday. So that's the good news.\n\n\"We hope that we will be able to continue to make that progress sooner rather than later and be able to come to a contract (agreement).\"\n\nSchool Committee Alison Taylor, who is not on the Bargaining Sub-Committee with Fox and Schaeffner, concluded the School Committee presentation by noting that while she understands the emotions surrounding the prolonged talks she is disheartened by the rhetoric that suggests the School Committee members are the villains amid the budget constraints.\n\n\"We are facing the problems,\" she said. \"I don't know that anybody is avoiding the problems. I have children in the school district too and I hope that people will review (the proposals) and understand that there is only so much that five people can do.\n\n\"It is so hard day after day to read post after post (on social media). You would think the five people here are the devil. ... To hear the names that we're called, the assumptions that get placed on us. ... We aren't avoiding the problem.

In September, clergy in Rome overturned Hicks' unpopular decision of closing St. Joseph's Parish in downtown Joliet. \n\nHicks had until Nov. 9, or 60 days, to decide whether to appeal the Dicastery for Clergy's decision to a higher court in the Vatican. However, he has decided to honor the decision of the Dicastery, parishioners at St. Joseph have learned.\n\nInstead, with St. Joseph's now remaining as a standalone parish, Hicks will now move ahead with a merger of St. Mary Magdalene's, St. Anthony's and St. Bernard's. A meeting will take place from 6 to 8 p.m. in the St. Mary Magdalene gymnasium on Tuesday, Oct. 22. \n\nThe churches at St. Anthony's and St. Bernard's were closed permanently this summer. \n\nOn Thursday, Joliet Patch interviewed attorney \n\n who is considered one of the world's leading law experts on the topic of Roman Catholic Church mergers. Despite never having visited Joliet, Hale was responsible for taking on the plight of St. Joseph's Parish and prevailing on their behalf during the past 10 months to save the parish.\n\nHale said he's grateful that Bishop Hicks decided not to appeal the Dicastery of Clergy's decision in favor of the parish that keeps the St. Joseph's Catholic Church as its own parish.\n\nThe September decision from the Vatican was so strongly worded in favor of the downtown Joliet parish, according to Hale, that Hicks didn't have strong prospects for overturning the decision in an appeal process.\n\n\"St. Joseph's is the eighth parish in the United States and the world that had its closure reversed in modern history,\" Hale explained. \"And six of those decisions were this year alone.\n\n\"Rome is giving deeper scrutiny to even parishes now. (Still,) it is far harder to overturn a parish closure versus a church closure,\" Hale noted. \n\nAs far as taking on the plight of the St. Joseph's Parish, Hale remarked, \"I was cautiously optimistic. Given the level of mistakes that were made when the new parish was created by Bishop Hicks, I knew there was a very tall mountain for them (the Diocese of Joliet) to climb.\"\n\nAs for the September decision that made St. Joseph the eighth parish in North American to prevail, Hale said, \"It was a very strong decision, but I felt what was the (biggest mistake) was when the new parish created by Bishop Hicks, St. Joseph's Church was outside of the boundaries of the new parish that Bishop Hicks wanted to create.\"\n\nRegarding Bishop Hicks, Hale had this to say:\n\n\"I'm not gloating or trying to embarrass Bishop Hicks,\" Hale stressed. \"I'm grateful he's decided to end it, letting these good people get back to celebrating the sacraments is a great thing. I believe this parish is truly an integral part of the Diocese of Joliet and the city of Joliet.\" \n\nIn March, Bishop Hicks named Fr. John Hornicak as the parochial administrator for his ill-conceived plan that aimed to close St. Joseph's Parish and make St. Joseph's a secondary worship site, with St. Mary Magdalene on Briggs Street becoming the main worship site.\n\n"},

It is what it is, so I guess I say the meeting's over.\"\n\nBy that time, a half dozen officers were on hand. \n\nLeaving the building, attendees still argued, with officers following them. One woman told the protesters that she opposed the disruption, but agreed that Israel \"needs to stop occupying\" Gaza.\n\nOne of the protesters took exception to her criticism of the shouting, referring to the fact that she was a white woman. \n\nA Gaza-supporting man wearing a face mask shouted at her and others, \"You're a white supremacist, all of you!\" \n\nAnd then he asked the woman who opposed Israel's actions, \"Are you proud to be a white supremacist, ma'am? Maybe it's because your heart is dead.\"\n\nAs she approached her car, the masked man said that he had seen her before and labeled her as \"disgusting.\"\n\nAn officer told the crowd, \"Keep it moving.\"\n\nThe man continued to shout at the woman, referring to the people killed by Israel. \n\n\"You don't give a f– about them,\" he said. \n\n\"I do actually,\" the woman said. \n\nThe man shot back, \"Then why don't you act like it?\"\n\n\"Because you're not giving me a chance,\" the woman said as she entered her SUV. \n\nCasten has dealt with disruptions by opponents of U.S. policy on Israel before.

Your next,\" and the lawsuit alleges Pedroza did nothing to assure Antonucci's safety. \n\nAntonucci also alleges Pedroza told the staff at Manchester Township Middle School, where Pedroza was the principal, that Berenato and Antonucci were \"ruining Manchester,\" and that administrators began a campaign to get rid of them and others who supported Berenato. \n\n\"Plaintiff was not only identified as a member of the rainbow community by virtue of her vocal support of Mr. Berenato, but also of the mandated New Jersey curriculum which highlights and promotes diversity, including economic diversity, equity, inclusion, tolerance, and belonging in connection with gender and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, disabilities, and religious tolerance; as well as the political, economic, and social contributions of persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people at the middle and high school level,\" the lawsuit says. \n\nAntonucci alleges board member Gayle Mount made bigoted statements about the district's efforts to obtain a preschool expansion grant, saying the Orthodox community and Hispanic community could pay for preschool themselves, as Mount had to do, according to the lawsuit. \n\nAntonucci alleges Pedroza made bigoted statements on multiple occasions during the two-plus years she was in the district, such as wanting multi-language learners to receive 504 classifications and be placed in special education classes. That was a move Antonucci says was \"patently illegal and discriminatory.\" Antonucci alleges that when she spoke up against such statements she was harassed.\n\nPart of the harassment happened after Antonucci suffered a concussion during an incident at school, according to the lawsuit. The incident that caused the injury is not described, but she was receiving care from the district's workers' compensation doctors, according to the lawsuit. \n\nWhile she was receiving treatment, Antonucci worked reduced hours and Pedroza demanded a doctor's note, in spite of the fact that Antonucci was being treated by the district's doctors, the lawsuit says. When Antonucci asked about receiving treatment during the workday, because of schedule conflicts, the district told the workers' compensation carrier to cancel her workday appointments. That happened after Antonucci complained that Pedroza had made anti-Semitic statements, according to the lawsuit. \n\nAntonucci said the district also took away all of the sick, personal and vacation time that she had received as part of her agreement with Trethaway to join the district, according to the suit. \n\nOnce Antonucci had medical accommodations in place, Pedroza began monitoring her work intensely, sitting in on child study team meetings, leaving her out of meetings and overriding decisions Antonucci made about staff members under her supervision, according to the lawsuit. \n\nWhen Pedroza notified Antonucci in April 2024 that her contract was not being renewed, Antonucci requested the reasons and said the reasons she was provided were \"merely a pretext for removing an employee who had promoted tolerance and inclusion along with former Superintendent Berenato. Moreover, the stated Reasons were further skewed by evaluating Plaintiff’s performance during her concussion recovery.\"\n\nThe lawsuit asks for unspecified compensatory pay and damages.\n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/oakforest/teen-cancer-fight-project-fire-buddies-share-spotlight-new-show", "article": "CHICAGO — An area teen enduring a cancer fight—and the Oak Forest-based nonprofit rallying around her—will shine under a national spotlight Sunday, as they're featured in a show airing on ABC7. \n\nFourteen-year-old Reyna Arreguin, of Cicero, has felt her world turn upside down since a pancreatic cancer diagnosis just months ago. Nonprofit \n\n—a volunteer-led effort by local fire departments to show support for children battling critical illness and their families—stepped in, taking Reyna under their wing in an attempt to lift her spirits. \n\nAnd it worked. \n\nTheir efforts and a sweet celebrity surprise for Reyna will be shared nationwide Sunday, Oct. 20, in a show titled \"Hearts of Heroes,\" set to air at 4:30 p.m. on ABC7. \n\nInvited into the TV world of NBC's \"Chicago Fire,\" Reyna was surprised by her favorite actor David Eigenberg (known as “Herrmann” on the show) at her home, and he welcomed her to the set for a behind-the-scenes look. The show captures the heartwarming encounter, and the joy it brought Reyna amidst the stress of her battle.\n\n\"She was so happy,\" her mother Nancy Anacleto told Patch. \"Everything else went out the window.\"\n\nReyna was diagnosed in February after experiencing pain in her stomach. Initially mistaken for gastritis, an ultrasound would later show a large mass on her pancreas. Within two weeks, she underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder, part of her small intestine and a large portion of her pancreas. \n\n\"... the tumor was so massive,\" Anacleto said. \"Luckily, they were able to take out all the cancer cells around it. They had to re-arrange her stomach and her intestines. Reroute everything.\"\n\nIn the week after the surgery, Reyna was hospitalized, and unable to eat. It was then she got hooked on \"Chicago Fire,\" binge-watching episodes and growing attached to the characters. \n\n\"She fell in love with the show,\" Anacleto said,\"and she’s been watching it ever since.\"\n\nEigenberg, who has worked closely with Project Fire Buddies on other special moments in the past, was touched by Reyna's story. \n\n\"... she’s such a spark of life,\" Eigenberg told Patch. \"Such a sweet, endearing, kind person. She’s going through a time a young person should never have to go through.\"\n\nEigenberg worked with the Cicero chapter of Project Fire Buddies—of which Reyna is the first official fire buddy—to plan the surprise. Portraying a first responder on the show has inspired his admiration of those in real life. \n\n\"First responders go above and beyond, taking care of people, rescuing people,\" Eigenberg said. \n\nThose involved with Project Fire Buddies take their service to another level. \n\n \"Now in their off time, they’re going to find children and young people, in adversity or with disease, and supporting them,\" he said. \"They go above and beyond, and then go above and beyond again.\"\n\nIt's what's at the heart of the organization, an effort that started in 2016 with a few Oak Forest firefighters playing air hockey with a child fighting cancer. They pulled up in the fire truck, with sirens glowing, carrying gifts and flashing smiles for the first-ever \"fire buddy.\" It was a mere concept that has since grown beyond its founder's imagination. \n\n\"When we started Project Fire Buddies, it began with a simple prayer—to help the most vulnerable in our community,\" CEO Kurt DeGroot told Patch. \"Looking back now, it all makes perfect sense.\"\n\n\"First responders are natural helpers,\" he added, \"and Project Fire Buddies has created a bridge that enables that instinct to flourish. What’s been truly inspiring is seeing the broader community rally around these incredible kids. Help comes in so many forms—whether it’s sharing our posts, starting conversations, proudly wearing our gear, participating in volunteer events, or even in giveaways. \n\n\"Every act of kindness, no matter how big or small, spreads love and joy. At its core, it’s about being a good human and making the world a little brighter than we found it.\"\n\nThe now not-so-small and very mighty organization has expanded to 110 chapters across 10 states. \n\n\"... the growth continues to spread like wildfire,\" DeGroot said. \"It's an exciting journey for everyone involved, and the momentum is showing no signs of slowing down. We're thrilled to be expanding our reach and making a difference in more lives every day.\"\n\nThe significance of the organization being featured in a national spotlight is not lost on DeGroot. \n\n\"It is an incredible honor for Project Fire Buddies to receive this kind of national recognition,\" he said. \"This spotlight not only highlights the remarkable work we do, but most importantly, it shines a light on our courageous Fire Buddies—the real heroes in this world. \n\n\"These amazing children can proudly say, 'I'm a Fire Buddy,' knowing that they have a vast and supportive family of first responders standing by their side. This recognition offers us a valuable opportunity to expand that beautiful family and continue growing our mission of support and love.\"\n\nBeing a part of Project Fire Buddies has helped Reyna and her mother stay grounded, as everything about her cancer swirls around them. \n\n\"It means a lot, and brings a smile to her face all the time,\" Anacleto said. \"This whole thing has been a rollercoaster. In February, it was the worst time of our lives, because we didn’t know what to expect. … We still don’t know. It shattered both of us.\"\n\nReyna is doing well, and thus far does not have to undergo chemotherapy or radiation. Her biggest challenge currently, Anacleto said, is her liver function, along with ability to process nutrients. It's possible the tumor's presence affected her body's ability to absorb nutrients, she said, and she is unable to gain weight. \n\nOtherwise, she is not in any pain and is feeling well. \n\nNow Reyna and her mother are looking forward to the premiere event for the show, including a red carpet walk. They'll both dress to impress for the occasion, where they'll again rub elbows with celebrities—including retired Chicago Blackhawks Stanley Cup champion Brent Sopel, and Eigenberg.\n\n\"David is more than just a celebrity—he's truly a salt-of-the-earth kind of person,\" DeGroot said, of Eigenberg. \"His genuine love for Project Fire Buddies and the kids we support shines through in everything he does. He’s gone above and beyond for our organization, and it’s clear he’s not just involved, but deeply invested. On a personal level, I’ve been a huge fan of his work for years, so having the privilege of calling him a friend and getting to know the real David has been a tremendous blessing. It’s a rare gift to meet someone so grounded and kindhearted, especially in this capacity.\"\n\nBoth Reyna and her mother are a bit jittery, but they know that'll change once they're there. \n\n\"We’re very nervous, but they make it 100 times easier to ease our nerves,\" Anacleto said. \n\nThe show stars ABC News Chief meteorologist Ginger Zee and Sheldon Yellen, CEO and founder of\n\nBELFOR Property Restoration, the parent company of 1-800 BOARDUP. The episode featuring Reyna and her family is titled \"Hope and Hoofs.\" \n\n\"Reyna is truly one of the heroes we always speak about at Project Fire Buddies,\" DeGroot said. \"Our mission is to deliver smiles, and we never want to limit the possibilities of what we can achieve. \n\n\"When Josh from our Cicero chapter and I brainstormed ideas, I reached out to David, and as always, he took things to a whole new level. His dedication is beyond words. Watching Reyna and her family's faces light up was absolutely priceless. When we met with Alex from Hearts of Heroes, I couldn’t wait to share what we had planned. Alex is the kind of person who elevates everything she touches, and working with her and her team at 1-800-BoardUp helped us break through that ceiling and deliver something truly extraordinary for Reyna.\"\n\nEigenberg said he's honored to be part of Project Fire Buddies. \n\n\"If I could put a smile on somebody’s face for a few minutes, and I’ve got the time, I’m happy to jump in and do that,\" he said. \n\n\"There’s virtue everywhere, but these days, it can be hard to find. They’re chock full of it.\"\n\nReyna's fandom of the show and interaction with first responders in real time has inspired her career choice. \n\n\"She’s a really good kid,\" Anacleto said. \"She’s very driven—whatever she sets her mind to, she accomplishes. Because of the show, and now because of Project Fire Buddies, she wants to be a first responder.\"\n\nShe attends Morton Freshman Center, where she's already begun studying bio-medical advanced classes, \"so she can get her feet wet in the field,\" Anacleto said. \n\n\"I do believe she will change the world one day,\" she said. \"All her teachers have told me that since she was in 2nd grade. \n\n\"And I believe it, now more than ever.\"\n\n"},

Dave Marsden (D-Burke) told Patch in September that he intends to reintroduce his \n\n after the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee \n\n for the 2025 legislative session.\n\nIf passed, Marsden’s bill would give the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors authority to put a referendum on a ballot so voters could decide whether a casino would be built somewhere on the Metro’s Silver Line outside the Capital Beltway. \n\n \n\nOne of the reasons Marsden gave for building an entertainment district anchored by a casino would be to create 5,000 union jobs. He and other supporters, including Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Alexandria), promoted a casino as a new revenue stream for Fairfax County, which relies too heavily on the real estate tax to fund county programs.\n\n“The developer has agreed to a project labor agreement for the entertainment district and casino,” said Greg Akerman, president of the area Building Trades unions. “A PLA will guarantee that workers are paid family-sustaining wages and Fairfax County residents have the chance to get on-the-job training opportunities through apprenticeship programs.”\n\nAlthough neither Akerman nor the press release identifies who the developer is, Patch \n\n in September 2023 that Comstock Holding Companies was seeking to build a casino somewhere on the Silver Line in Fairfax County.\n\nSince then, Comstock Holdings, its employees, entities and allies have donated more than $1.2 million to the campaigns committees of members of the Virginia Legislature in an effort to advance their casino plans.\n\n“This is an important opportunity to bring in more commercial tax revenue for schools and other county services, which is sorely needed,” said David Walrod, president of the Fairfax County Federation of Teachers.\n\nIn addition to a casino, the entertainment district would include a “high-end hotel with gaming floor, convention center, concert venue, restaurants, retail, and workforce housing,” according to the release. The entire development would take up 4 million square feet, with the casino only encompassing 200,000 square feet.\n\nPatch reached out for comment from the \n\n, a vocal opponent to the casino. Lynne Mulston, a spokeswoman for the group, provided this statement:\n\nDuring a hearing of the \n\non Jan. 24, several people spoke in favor of Marsden's bill, including Julie Coons, president of the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, and Benita Thompson-Byas, the vice chairman of the Thompson Hospitality Corporation. \n\n\"The creation of a mixed-use, transit-oriented complex that would include not only a casino, but a state-of-the-art conference facility and performing arts venue is estimated to contribute an additional $2 billion to the region and would bring thousands of new jobs to Fairfax County,\" Coons told the subcommittee members.\n\n was a minority partner in the casino project, according to Thompson-Byas. The company manages several regional restaurant chains, including Big Buns, matchbox, and Milk & Honey.\n\n"},

The GDP only outlines the site's zoning and maximum heights of the buildings, and does not include how many structures will be built or where parking will be. \n\nThe township has long been expecting the 181-acre site to become a new residential complex, but officials only recently reached a preliminary agreement with the property owners over the exact placement of the apartment buildings, and how tall they would be. \n\n\"(The owners) insisted on four eight-story buildings up until very recently,\" Mayor Chris Vergano said at the meeting. The GDP includes one eight-story building and several other buildings that can be between three and five stories tall. \n\nThe final settlement agreement with Point View Wayne Properties has not yet been executed, officials said Wednesday; the Planning Board will discuss it in a \n\n during their meeting on Oct. 28. \n\nThe plan is for 1,360 residential units to be built on the mostly-vacant site, with 272 residences set aside for affordable housing. This number of units was set forth in a \n\n with the Fair Share Housing Center, and the township hosted a \n\n about the Toys \"R\" Us site and a number of other ongoing housing projects in February of that year.\n\nDuring a public hearing Wednesday about the \n\n for the property, residents expressed concerns about increased traffic on Geoffrey Way, proposed environmental issues, added strain on existing sewer infrastructure, and potential stormwater runoff into the Point View Reservoir and other nearby waterways.\n\nSeveral people also asked for a greater \"buffer zone\" between the development and the nearby Lionshead Lake and Pines Lake neighborhoods, so the buildings were not so close to their homes. \n\nTownship planners said that they could likely not re-negotiate that part of the settlement with Point View Wayne Properties, which set the buffer at 100 feet. \n\nSince the land is owned by a private company, and Wayne is constitutionally mandated to provide its \"fair share\" of affordable housing, Vergano and some other officials said the township was limited in what it could control on this project.\n\nThe ordinance on the general development plan passed 5-2, with 5th Ward councilwoman Francine Ritter and 2nd Ward councilman Al Sadowski voting \"no.\" Council members Jill Sasso and Jonathan Ettman were not present at the meeting. \n\nRitter and Sadowski have both been critical of the process to pass the GDP, with Ritter saying again Wednesday that the township had ample time to prepare for the next round of Mount Laurel affordable housing obligations, and planned developments themselves rather than leaving it up to the courts. \n\n\"What have we been doing the past 16, 20, 26 years? We knew we had an obligation,\" Ritter asked. \"It seems we do a better job of negotiating with private developers' lawyers than we do with lawyers that serve our interests.\"\n\nPlanner Chris Koch said that when Point View Wayne approached officials in 2019 about this particular project, the township was still far from meeting their third round obligation of 2,271 affordable units. \n\n\"Until we meet the full (obligation), we can't turn anyone away,\" he said. \"When they came forward, we had to engage with them. And if the projects met the criteria under the state — if it's developable, buildable, and so on — we had to work with them.\"\n\nIn other business, council members also introduced two bond ordinances: One authorizing $1,638,750 for a new Pierce Pumper Truck for Fire Company #5, and another that would appropriate $1,435,000 for the resurfacing of West Belt Parkway. \n\nAnd, there will be a slight change in the fee structure for the soon-to-be Wayne Community Center, for standard monthly memberships: A \"student\" category has been added for residents between the ages of 14 and 17. \n\nSo, for residents, the standard monthly memberships are priced as follows:\n\n"},

Bob Morgan, 44, a Deerfield Democrat.\n\nDuring the forum, Morgan emphasized legislative accomplishments such as sponsoring the statewide assault weapons ban, making health insurance companies cover mental health care and paying down the pension backlog. \n\nMeanwhile, Lambrecht's sometimes cryptic responses ranged from questionable claims to personal anecdotes.\n\n\"Should a judge issue an order to remove firearms and ammunition from anyone who has an order of protection issued against them?\" asked moderator Jan Flapan. \"If not, why not?\"\n\n\"I don’t know what you mean 'protection.'

That is an incredibly important issue for our community and every community, as we see children being killed at record numbers due to guns being so accessible. We have 400 million guns in the United States and 300 million people. We have more guns than people,\" Morgan said. \"So the reality is, we have to do more. When there’s an order of protection, we need to remove that firearm. Law enforcement has to step in—not just to save that person’s life, but to save everyone’s life.\"\n\nThe candidates differed on the SAFE-T Act, which eliminated cash bail in state criminal court just over a year prior to the \n\n, which was sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Deerfield-Lincolnshire, Highland Park-Highwood, Lake County and the Lake Forest-Lake Bluff area.\n\nMorgan said the end of monetary bail was an incredible success, especially with regard to the detention of defendants in domestic violence cases.\n\n\"It’s becoming successful because the people who are a danger to society are being detained, and the people that are not are not being detained just because they don’t have the money,\" Morgan said.\n\nLambrecht said he believed the opposite.\n\n\"There are only two counties that have this — Cook County and Lake County,\" Lambrecht said incorrectly. \n\nIn fact, the state's attorneys of those two counties were the only ones to publicly lobby for the passage of the bill but cash bail has been eliminated statewide.\n\n\"We have a lot of people who are coming into the state from who knows where, who are criminals in the first place. They find guns, and off they go killing people,\" Lambrecht said. \"And marijuana has killed people. You may not know about it, but they have.\"\n\nLambrecht is the owner of a Highland Park precision optics manufacturing firm and a Moraine Township GOP precinct committeeperson. He ran unsuccessfully for school board 13 years ago and was unopposed in his bid for the Republican nomination in this spring's primary.\n\nWearing a \"Cold War Veteran\" baseball cap, the only qualification he proffered during the forum was his belief in God and the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"This is a position that guarantees that I do [a] good job, it doesn't mean I always obey everything, but I try,\" he said.\n\nAfter several digressions into communist industrial policy in unspecified foreign countries, Lambrecht spent his closing remarks explaining that he completed three years of high school, three years of university and took some graduate classes in optics and lasers.\n\n\"I went to high school and college at the same time. I never graduated from either of those institutions, but I learned what I wanted to learn, and I thought that was enough for me,\" Lambrecht said. \"It gave me the opportunity to travel to over 40 countries and see the world and understand what life is like in many different types of countries.\"\n\nBoth candidates were asked about the proliferation of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are also known as “forever chemicals\" and used in various household and industrial applications. Two were designated as hazardous substances by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year and peer-reviewed studies have shown them accumulating in Lake Michigan.\n\nMorgan said he supported looking at ways to prohibit their proliferation in water and air and ways that government can stop buying them, even though there is opposition to an outright ban.\n\n\"There are things, levers that government has to reduce the proliferation of these chemicals, and we should start immediately,” Morgan said. “We already know the ways in which plastics are infiltrating our water systems. It’s a real problem that we are running the risk of being too late to address if we don’t immediately take drastic actions to keep ourselves and our future generations, our children and our grandchildren, safe from these chemicals.\"\n\nLambrecht did not appear to be familiar with PFAS or microplastic pollution.\n\n\"Forever chemicals? You mentioned plastics. It depends on which plastics. Maybe you don’t realize it, you have eat sausages sometimes you’re eating plastics, and it doesn’t seem to do anything to anyone,\" Lambrecht said. \n\n\"Plastic bags? we use them all over the house. I use it as packing material,\" he said. \"I don’t see any plastics going into Lake Michigan, but I suppose somebody says they are.\"\n\nIn fact, a Rochester Institute of Technology study published eight years ago \n\n there was about 11.6 million pounds of plastic entering Lake Michigan every year.\n\nMicroplastics, defined as pieces of plastic under 5 mm, can be ingested by aquatic life and make their way \n\n. And while wastewater treatment plants in the region capture the majority of microplastics, some still escape, accumulating over time in the water and sediment. \n\nA decade ago, the race for the 58th District was still relatively competitive, with Republican candidates regularly getting more than 40 percent of the vote against former State Rep. Scott Drury prior to the last round of redistricting.\n\nSince Morgan won the seat by a solid margin in 2018, it has been a Democratic stronghold. In 2020, he ran unopposed, and in 2022, he wound up with more than 70 percent of the vote. \n\n\"We've done a lot in the last six years that I've been there. I primarily focus my work on expanding access to quality and cost-effective health care, and also leading the state's legislation on gun violence prevention,\" Morgan said. \n\n\"We've done incredible things with regards to balancing the state's budget, digging us out of the hole that we have been building for years and decades in Illinois, so that we can better serve those constituents that need help, so it's been a true honor to have this role,\" he said. \n\n\"The reason I'm running for re-election is because there's so much more to do, so many more individuals who are struggling to get by — in human services in behavioral health care access — things that we really need to work on that the state can do better,\" he said. \"And that's what I'm running to make sure I have the opportunity to continue in Springfield and work on these issues so we can help everybody have the opportunity they deserve.\"\n\n"},

She’s had so many — meeting stars like Gene Kelly, traveling to almost every state and to far away places from Antarctica to Myanmar to Machu Picchu and even visiting Cuba in her 90s. \n\nBut don’t count on it.\n\nThe centenarian isn’t looking back. She has her mind on the good times ahead.\n\nHer birthday wish?\n\n“Just to keep things going as well as they're going now,” said Jennifer McMullen. “We just plan on doing what we're doing. It's been working so far.”\n\nIt’s been working so well, Jennifer and her husband Mel McMullen are among less than the 1,000 couples who have been married 75 years or longer in this country.\n\nTwo years ago, they moved into the \n\n assisted living facility together, where they will celebrate her 100th birthday Sunday and Mel McMullen's six months from now.\n\nThe day will feature birthday cake and root beer floats, a video tribute, proclamations from presidents and senators, live music by her son Tim McMullen and warm wishes from friends and family.\n\nHer biggest admirer, however, will be the same person who’s been at her side cheering her on for 78 years.\n\nIt wasn’t love at first sight, but it was pretty close to it.\n\nJennifer and a friend from her native Ohio had rented a room from Mel's mother while her sons fought in World War II. \n\nJennifer had briefly dated Mel’s brother, which is how she came to know his mom.\n\n“His brother always said, you know, you should meet my younger brother. You'd be good with him,” Jennifer recalled. \n\n“When I came home from China, I first looked at her, and I thought she was a beautiful person, not only in looks, but in acts and everything,” said Mel. “I consider myself one of the luckiest guys in the world, and it's been quite a few years since 1946 when I walked in the front door and saw her sitting there.”\n\nSix weeks after that fateful day, they were engaged. Not long after that, there was a double wedding. The Ohio girls married the McMullen brothers, raising two families as close as could be. \n\nOver the years, the love is still strong.\n\n“He was the most caring person I had met up to that point when I married him,” Jennifer said. “He was very wonderful, young and thoughtful, and he hasn't lost those traits, and that's probably why I still love him.”\n\nThe key to such a long, happy marriage and life? \n\nHaving a sense of humor, both McMullens said.\n\nLaughter was always a big part of the family, said their son Tim McMullen.\n\nBut watching his parents, he learned about more than enjoying the good times. \n\n“I think personal integrity is something that they have always exhibited and instilled in us,” he said. “I was a high school teacher for 40 plus years, and it was those values of honesty, integrity, good sense, good judgment, and common sense that I, too, tried to pass on to my students. I think they have exhibited that from their participation, as PTA president and Cub Scout leaders and Boy Scout leaders and the National Commander of the China Burma India Veterans Association. My mom has basically been president of every organization in Whittier and San Bernardino over the last 50 years or so.”\n\nEven now at Oakmont, Jenniffer McMullen is vice president of the resident’s association.\n\nBoth husband and wife remain active at the assisted living facility. The move was an adjustment for the couple, but it’s been a happy one. Change is something Jennifer McMullen has gotten used to in her century of living. She went from riding a horse and buggy to school as a child to texting and using an iPad in her 90s. She was born just four years after women got the right to vote in the United States, and now she hopes to see a woman elected to the White House in her lifetime.\n\nIn the meantime, Jennifer McMullen plans to continue doing what she's always done.\n\n“If you want to live a long time, you find a good man and have a nice family, and keep reading. Of course, that's what we always do,” she said. “And just enjoy life.”\n\n"},

An earlier charges had a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, but the amended charges each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years instead.\n\nAccording to court records, McBeth spent about a week with a 15-year-old girl in December 2015, during which he forced her to have sex with strangers for money — in places like an Elk Grove Motel 6 and a Travel Inn in Broadview — and pocketed the estimated $5,000 they paid her. \n\nMcBeth, also known as \"Tony,\" admitted in his guilty plea that he picked up the teen from the Department of Children's and Family Services group home where she lived, bought her makeup, drove her around to engage in prostitution and provided her with alcohol, marijuana, condoms and new clothes.\n\n Prosecutors sought a sentence of 18 years in prison, citing the \"heinous\" nature of the crime.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Peterson said the girl, who had told McBeth she was 19, repeatedly asked to go home but he did not take her. \n\nPeterson said in a sentencing memo that the girl lived apart from her younger sisters, who were also in DCFS custody, and wanted to buy winter coats and Christmas presents for them.\n\n\"Instead of accomplishing her holiday goal, [the 15-year-old], at [McBeth's] direction, had sex with men in their apartments and houses in exchange for money. [McBeth], not [the teen], kept almost all of the thousands of dollars she earned. He gave her drugs and alcohol to keep her working. He used the money she earned to buy himself a car,\" Peterson said. \"And on Christmas Eve, he took her back to the DCFS group home, giving her little more than $100 and leaving her with a lifetime of emotional scars.\"\n\nIn one case, the girl was left bleeding from an encounter with a man who did not speak any English and, in another, was restrained by McBeth's accomplice as she pickpocketed a customer.\n\n\"[McBeth] repeatedly put [the teen] in harms’ way for his own profit. When she needed help from a violent customer, he didn’t help her. And his girlfriend,\" according to Peterson, \"did not help [the girl] either. Instead, she too victimized [her], holding her down and forcing her to continue to engage in a sex act with a 'creepy' stranger.\"\n\nCourt documents detail how McBeth and his girlfriend had been banned from the Broadview motel after employees noticed they were showing up with young girls and apparently involved in prostitution. \n\nJonathan Bedi, McBeth's court-appointed attorney, argued in favor of sentence of 100 months — less than eight and a half years. \n\n\"William is not the same person he was in 2015. In the years after this offense and before his arrest, he completely withdrew from all criminal activity, got sober, and did nothing but concentrate on building a supportive life for his family and daughter,\" Bedi said.\n\nAccording to Bedi, McBeth completely turned his life around and cut off contact with the criminal underworld during the five years between the conduct for which he is convicted and the time he was indicted.\n\n\"At the time of these offenses, drugs had taken over William’s life. He had lost perspective and any sense of morality,\" Bedi argued. \"William did not use the proceeds from this case to buy cars, a house, clothes, shoes, or even food. He used the funds to buy drugs. His need for drugs guided his actions, and the illegal activity he participated in was the way he saw to obtain these drugs\"\n\nHowever, according to an \n\n from FBI agent Tenzin Atsatsang, McBeth and the girl went together to a Lexus dealership in Arlington Heights, where he used $2,000 in cash, fake paystubs and the address of a Chicago Public School to finance the purchase of a car.\n\n\"In William’s words, 'I feel like a lot of bad choices I made in my life was because of being on drugs.' He also recalled that when he was high, 'I didn’t think about consequences' and ' I [now] take full responsibility for everything I did,'\" according to the defense sentencing memo. \"Ultimately, William says, 'I want to show society that I can be the person I want to be.'\"\n\nIn addition to sentencing him to a dozen years in federal prison, U.S. District Judge Franklin Valderrama on Thursday ordered McBeth to pay nearly $66,600 in restitution to his victim.\n\n"},

Jacques, 50, was arrested on Friday on unknown charges, government sources confirmed to Patch. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday. He was out on bail on delayed sentencing after pleading guilty to a single felony count of distribution of child sexual abuse material in March. Marc Jacques is the father of Maëlle Des Lauriers Jacques, a trans athlete and goalie on the Kearsarge girls’ soccer team, and had been attending his child’s games before his arrest. \n\nDuring the past few weeks, parents wondered whether Maëlle Des Lauriers Jacques was legally allowed to play after the passage of HB 1205. Legal challenges have blocked the implementation of the law. Three weeks ago, \n\n, due to safety concerns about \n\n. \n\nOn Oct. 7, Marc Jacques was seen with a cellphone at a Hopkinton vs. Kearsarge soccer game. Later, parents learned he had just been convicted on a child sexual abuse material distribution charge. A photo of him with the cell phone began circulating on Facebook and online.\n\nBishop Brady High School in Concord was scheduled to play at Kearsarge on Friday. \n\nSchool officials debated the situation for two weeks after its principal, Andrea Elliot, received inquiries about canceling the game, issues at Bow High School and \n\n, and Marc Jacques’ conviction. Elliot did not believe there was a safety concern and stated Marc Jacques was in his vehicle at the game — something disproven by the circulating photo. After discussing the situation with the superintendent and diocese, Elliot emailed the school community. \n\nIn the email, Superintendent David Thibault stated the team would play. \n\n“As Catholic Christians,” he wrote, “we will not isolate, polarize, or demonize, but instead, participate with the best sportsmanship and fairness that is endemic to Catholic formation.” \n\nElliot said Kearsarge would also have local police and administrators on duty at the game. Behind the soccer benches, a “no fan zone perimeter” would also be instituted.\n\nThe game was reportedly canceled after the team told Elliot they would not play after several fathers came forward and said they did not want their daughters playing at the game. \n\nThe investigation into Marc Jacques began about three years ago. \n\nAccording to court documents, he uploaded 49 files of child sexual abuse material on the social media platform Kik between November and December 2021. His IP address in Newbury, as well as the residence of a girlfriend in Hopkinton, were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and were connected to at least 40 CyberTips related to online sexual exploitation of children between 2018 and 2022, as reported by Reddit, Google, Tumblr, and sendvid. A search of the Kik account found at least 26 files had been disseminated in messages during the same period. \n\nA federal search warrant of Marc Jacques and his home and vehicle was issued in June 2022.\n\nInvestigators found 14 photos and 148 videos “depicting previously identified victims” on one laptop, as well as an image and five videos on a second laptop. On his iPhone, investigators found 18 images and 42 videos as well as “chats” between Marc Jacques and others “related to child exploitation and the sharing of (material).” \n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office reported in March that “forensic examination of Jacques’ electronic devices revealed the presence of over 200 files of apparent (child sexual abuse material) as well as chats between him and others related to the sexual exploitation of children and sharing of (child sexual abuse material).”\n\nIn at least one chat, Marc Jacques sent videos of the child sexual abuse materials to others. \n\nThe statute for a single count was no less than five years but no more than 20 years in prison, at least five years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000. \n\nThe investigation involved the New Hampshire Internet Crimes Against Children, the Nashua Police Department, and the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Department. \n\nLast month, Jacques was sentenced to five years in prison and five years of supervised release. He was ordered to pay $26,500 to five girls who were identified as victims in the photos and-or videos. \n\n“Survivors of child sexual abuse material suffer from revictimization and live every day with fear that their abuse is being shared on the internet,” U.S. Attorney Jane E. Young said at the time. “Law enforcement in the District of New Hampshire will continue to utilize every resource available to disrupt the distribution of CSAM and incarcerate offenders convicted of these horrific crimes.”\n\nSpecial Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol for Homeland Security Investigations in New England said Jacques’ behavior was “flagged repeatedly by systems designed to detect predators sharing child sexual abuse materials,” and the sentence was “the result of the collaboration of private industry and the dedicated work of law enforcement who work together every day to see justice for the children victimized when these horrific images are produced.”\n\nBefore sentencing, Marc Jacques and his legal team presented letters from his children, counselors, and others requesting leniency. \n\nIn his three-page letter, Marc Jacques stated his ex-wife was opposed to his child’s gender-affirming medical care, so he was the sole supporter of his child in that decision. He said they were exploring options with the endocrinology and cryogenic departments at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, and they “will need my support.” Marc Jacques also described some of the legal activities and stress on his child since the legislature \n\n.\n\nAnother letter was from former Boston City Councilor Larry DiCara, an attorney who was the youngest city councilor at 22 when first elected in 1972. He stated he had known Marc Jacques for more than three decades, and while acknowledging “the seriousness of the charges,” his was “a complicated personal situation.” DiCara claimed he was not receiving financial support from his ex-wife — who was now married to a woman. He also \n\n. He suggested sentencing Marc Jacques to “extensive community service, whereby he would discuss the challenges we all face in the brave new world in which we all live due to the availability of electronic information of every possible variety, would be far more beneficial to the citizens of \n\n.”\n\nDespite knowledge of his crimes for years as well as six months between his guilty plea and sentencing, Marc Jacques requested a delayed prison entry — Dec. 2, to settle family matters and “to spend time with his children subsequent to sentencing will allow him to make arrangements for their wellbeing and plan for their future support.” Marc Jacques also requested to be housed at the Federal Medical Center-Devens in Massachusetts — the same facility where former \n\n. \n\nBoth requests were granted. \n\nAmanda Grady Sexton, the director of public affairs for the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, said victims of crime are often “shocked and terrified” when they learn judges can allow sexual offenders to remain in the community for months before they need to report to prison. \n\n“They’re also surprised to hear that offenders on probation or parole are routinely allowed to violate their conditions without facing any real accountability,” she sad. “Any judge who permits a child sexual offender to use social media while awaiting incarceration is in need of significant judicial education. Victims and children should not be subjected to further risk by certain judges who bend over backward to accommodate convicted sexual offenders.”\n\nMarc Jacques was required to make the restitution 60 days after selling his home on Old Post Road in Newbury and forfeited his computer equipment and hard drives. \n\nWhile his Friday arrest was confirmed, it is unknown why he was arrested. \n\nAccording to bail paperwork from the U.S. District Court filed in mid-March, Marc Jacques was required to refrain from possessing or using any computer, electronic communication, data storage device or media, or any Internet-capable media device unless preapproved by a probation officer. He was also required to have no access to the Internet unless preapproved. The bail conditions also said computer monitoring software or hardware would be installed on Marc Jacques’ computer, and his computer or any internal or external peripheral devices would be subject to examination. \n\nMarc Jacques was not banned, however, from using social media sites, including the one he used to share child pornography, according to the documents.\n\nWhile other documents related to exclusions he received were available, including a college visit out of state with his eldest son and a request to delay the sentencing from June to September to allow his eldest son to graduate high school and he could travel with him, no online documents were available showing Marc Jacques could possess a cellphone. \n\n"},

You could get a haunting surprise.\n\n“If you give me candy corn,” \n\n reader “Maleficent” said, we’re sure with big, black stink eye, “I will cast a spell on you.”\n\nThe divisive Halloween candy barely registered a blip on our informal Halloween candy throwdown survey for \n\n, Patch’s exclusive neighborhood etiquette column. Only Sour Patch Kids got fewer mentions when we asked what candy is best on Halloween and what kind of treats qualify the giver as the scariest person in the neighborhood.\n\nHere are the results of the informal survey:\n\nSome readers said candy corn deserves more respect than it got from Maleficent and a handful of other readers who think it’s the default candy of the archetypal scary neighbor.\n\n“Candy corn is traditional,” said “GothWitchGirl,” a \n\n reader. “It conjures up happy childhood memories!”\n\nIt’s also a fleeting treat, said \n\n reader Andrea.\n\n“Candy corn’s texture is tender and soft, the very sweetest and most unique flavor!” she, ahem, waxed on about the candy that is literally coated in edible wax. “Candy corn and pumpkins come in a range of prices, and we can taste them only for a few weeks each year.”\n\n reader Sydney can’t understand why Sour Patch Kids finished in the cellar, calling them “obviously a superior candy” noting there are “no worries about nut allergies or gluten, either.”\n\n reader “Jessica Rabbit” also feels slighted.\n\n“Twizzlers,” she said. “I cannot believe they didn’t make the list. My children automatically know not to touch them. They get set aside during the loot inventorying just for me!”\n\nAnd what is this, no Baby Ruth, either?\n\n“I have always loved Baby Ruth candy bars, the great combination of chocolate, nuts and the great consistency make it a wonderful treat — doesn’t even need a trick!” said \n\n reader “Scary Mary, Seer of All Things to Come.”\n\n“Milk Duds!” said \n\n reader Denna, also a member of the “something else” crowd in our survey. “They come three to a box, the perfect amount because they take time to chew. The enjoyment lasts longer because you have to work a little to eat them.”\n\nReese’s Peanut Butter Cups also topped last year’s \n\n. People are ardent in their defense of The Cups.\n\n“Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup is hands-down the best,” said New Yorker Alex V., who reads \n\n and \n\n. “The combination of peanut butter and chocolate is just a dream that cannot be matched.\n\n“Plus,” Alex V. continued, “the orange wrapper is truly festive for Halloween. Bonus points if you give out the pumpkin-shaped ones because we all know those have more peanut butter filling.”\n\nWho knew? Did you?\n\n“The Jalponator,” a \n\n reader, said The Cups are “undeniably the crown jewel of Halloween candy.”\n\n“The moment you unwrap that iconic orange and brown packaging, you’re greeted with the promise of heavenly chocolate melting into luscious, creamy peanut butter,” The Jalponator said. “There’s nothing quite like the joy of biting into a Reese’s.”\n\nThe “Queen of Hearts,” a \n\n, would do almost anything for a Reese’s.\n\n“I would risk getting into an argument with my toddler just to have a bite of a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup,” the Queen of Hearts said, adding, “If you met my toddler, you’d know what high stakes those are.”\n\nIn Maryland, H.E. says eating a Reese’s is a sensory pleasure with first a taste of chocolate, then the creamy peanut butter center, and then another taste of chocolate.\n\n“It’s eating the candy part by part that makes it mouth-watering and indulgent guilty pleasure,” the \n\nand \n\n reader said.\n\nOne thing could make The Cups better, according to a \n\n reader “Igor” or, alternatively, “Young Frankenstein.”\n\n“Chocolate and peanut butter, who could resist?” the reader said. “They just need to add bacon and they would be complete.”\n\nA \n\n reader hopes her grandchildren come home from trick-or-treating with plenty of KitKats in their buckets. \n\n“It’s what I steal,” she said.\n\n reader Jason was nostalgic about KitKats. \n\nThe bars “bring back memories from when I used to go trick-or-treating around our small neighborhood,” Jason said. “Loved getting these two favorites — chocolate on the outside and crispy on the inside.”\n\nIn Illinois, “Marcia Brady” stood up for KitKats for the same reason.\n\n“To me, KitKats are crunchy cookies covered in milk chocolate,” the \n\n and \n\n reader said. “No caramel to get stuck in your teeth. I love that they are rows that snap into long pieces that are easily bitten.”\n\nEvangelina, a \n\n reader, thinks a Butterfinger is a practical choice. “Pure sugar, with just a suggestion of peanut butter flavor, they weld kids’ teeth together so they can’t eat too much candy,” she said.\n\nM&Ms are perfect, said “Cheshire Cat,” who reads \n\n, \n\n and \n\n.\n\n“You may eat a lot, you may eat a few.

She also offers boxed drinks and bottled water if they’re thirsty.\n\nInstead of a thank you, Isle got the classic Halloween trick. \n\n“The next morning, lucky me gets to pick up the empties along my driveway and sidewalk,” she said.\n\nWhether under Plan A or Plan B, Isle will be handing out treats with her neighbors at the bottom of the hill that’s more community-oriented and doesn’t require arduous climbs. \n\n“We let the decorations do the scaring for us, unless I turn into a candy superhero,” said an \n\n reader who hopes for a trick-or-treat bounty of M&Ms because “it’s like eating tiny colorful bits of happiness.”\n\nThe reader left us with this bit of Halloween imagery:\n\n“My name is River but for Halloween, I transform into ‘Choco-Loco,’ the ultimate candy enthusiast! By day, I’m just a regular person, but by night, I roam the streets in search of all the finest treats.

Goodfriend was a long time Oak Lawn resident and an aide to former Congressman Bill Lipinski and, later, his son Congressman Dan Lipinski.\n\nGoodfriend went to work for Congressman Bill Lipinski in 1994. Looking to make inroads into the south suburban area of his district, Goodfriend came highly recommended by his chief of staff. \n\n“Lenore was a good political person,” Lipinski said. “Because she knew so many people and was involved in Oak Lawn organizations, I was advised to seriously consider hiring her. Once I got to know her I wanted to hire her.”\n\nAs a congressman, Bill Lipinski transplanted his experience as a Chicago alderman of fixing problems like potholes and overhanging tree limbs to his congressional office helping constituents navigate federal benefits, services and agencies. He put Goodfriend in charge of assisting the veterans who contacted the district seeking help.\n\nWord of mouth quickly spread about the “wonderful woman” in Congressman Lipinski’s office who helped veterans.\n\n“There was no question that she was a strong advocate for veterans,” the older Lipinski said. “Not only did she handle veteran affairs in my office, but for other veterans outside the district because they heard about the good job she did. If they needed something, she helped. It wasn’t political; she was interested in doing good for as many people as possible.”\n\nGoodfriend transitioned to working for Lipinski’s son, Dan, who replaced his father on the 2004 ballot when Bill Lipinski withdrew his name after winning the primary and announced his retirement. Theirs would be a political reign that lasted 45 years. \n\n“Lenore was one of the nicest, sweetest people I have ever known,” Dan Lipinski said. “She was also a good politician. She had been involved in local politics for decades. She had an eye for the political angle of issues.”\n\nUpon Goodfriend’s retirement from federal service in 2012, Congressman Dan Lipinski honored her with a proclamation from the house floor:\n\nGoodfriend was a cancer survivor and earlier this year got to spend time with extended family. She was a fixture at Johnson-Phelps VFW Post 5220, helping with events or holding court in the lounge where she was known to play her favorite singer Usher on the jukebox, or the machines. \n\nGoodfriend was born a Daley, one of seven children – Marijean (Hugh) O’Connell, Margaret Daley, Judy Daley, Eugene (Sandy) Daley, and the late Elizabeth (Steven) Ferencevich, & Dennis (Barbara) Daley.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her beloved husband, David Goodfriend. She was the cherished mother of Ann (William) Phillips, the loving grandmother of three and great-grandmother of three, a devoted aunt of many nieces and nephews, and a loyal and treasured friend of many.\n\nVisitation for Lenore Goodfriend will take place from 2 to 9 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 20, at \n\n, 5570 W. 95th St., Oak Lawn, where services will take place Monday, Oct. 21 at 10 a.m.\n\n"},

Maple St., where Tyler Koscinski was a familiar face as a barback. The event is set for Saturday, Oct. 26, from 4 to 8 p.m. Entry fee is a $20 donation; food and drink are not included. A 50/50 raffle will be held, along with raffle baskets and silent auction items offered. \n\nThe organization's founders are currently seeking 501c3 status for the foundation, Tyler's brother Connor Lowman previously told Patch. A website is also in progress. \n\n\"I’m going to make sure his name never dies,\" Connor Lowman said, \"and his story’s going to be told for years and years to come.\"\n\nKelly Koscinski believes some good can come from their family's devastating loss; Tyler would have wanted it that way.\n\n\"We just feel that this is now his purpose,\" she said previously. \n\nThe foundation was started shortly after Tyler's death, when a GoFundMe started by a family friend generated more than $30,000 initially, and nearly $42,000 to-date. \n\nTheir hope is to support athletes like Tyler—those fueled by passion and intense focus. Tyler played both football and baseball, matriculating through local youth sports clubs such as the New Lenox Mustangs Youth Football and Cheerleading. He was a dual-sport athlete until he turned his focus entirely to baseball later in high school, his father Chris Koscinski said.\n\n\"Baseball became the dominant sport for him,\" Chris previously told Patch. \"He put the work in, too, and it showed. Playing different positions, then settled into the shortstop position. Dominated that position, started hitting like a pro—hitting home runs, doubles, singles.\"\n\nHe was determined to grow his skills, Chris said.\n\n\"He was a workhorse.\"\n\nThe foundation's founders \"believe that every young athlete should have the opportunity to chase their dreams, regardless of their financial background. The Tyler Koscinski Memorial Foundation seeks to break down those financial barriers, fostering personal growth, community involvement, and the pursuit of excellence in both sports and life,\" according to its mission statement. \n\n\"The foundation is dedicated to empowering young athletes by providing scholarships to help them afford the essential equipment they need to compete. Additionally, we hope to provide scholarships for higher education down the road, helping athletes further both their academic and athletic journeys.\"\n\nKelly Koscinski hopes the nonprofit will both honor her son's memory and inspire other young athletes to keep pushing toward their goals—personal, academic, and athletic. \n\n\"He was known for his infectious smile, goofball nature, competitive spirit,\" she previously said. \"He was the heart of every gathering. A leader, on and off the field. A devoted friend, passionate. So loved.\"\n\n"},

At minute 25:46 the moderator asked: \"What is your position on the laws and policies regarding parental notification for transgender students?\"\n\nThe state of New Jersey \n\n last year, after the board tried to require Middletown schools notify parents when a student changes their name, pronoun or bathroom use. NJ Attorney General Matt Platkin argued Middletown was putting transgender/gender-questioning youth at risk, and possibly outing teens to parents who may not be supportive.\n\nDeb Wright — who is seeking re-election this fall — was the sole Board member to vote against Middletown's controversial transgender student policy. She rarely publicly speaks about why she voted that way.\n\nBut last Monday, she addressed it in length:\n\n\"As a parent myself, I think it's really important to have parental involvement. But I will say that the way we chose as a district to handle this situation really wasn't the right way to do it,\" said Wright. \"And the reason why I say that is because I think we signaled to a lot of our students that perhaps some of them weren't as welcome in our school community as they should be.\"\n\n\"I think we unfortunately made this more of a political issue than actually trying to figure out what we could do as a district to actually solve this problem,\" she continued. \"Bring all the stakeholders to the table and actually work together to come out with a policy that everyone felt good about, and that everyone in the school felt welcome. I think, unfortunately, this got to such a heightened degree that we sort of lost sight of what was happening here, which was: We had a policy that we found out was not mandated by the state. And instead of actually reaching out to the Attorney General's office — like I had suggested — ahead of time and trying to work through the policy with them on something that would be acceptable to everyone, unfortunately we found ourselves — no surprise — in a lawsuit, wasting thousands upon thousands of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nMiddletown passed its own transgender policy in response to \n\n, which is \"guidance\" from the NJ Department of Education that says New Jersey school districts are not required to inform parents if a student talks to a teacher/guidance counselor about their gender identity or sexual orientation. Last year, the state said Policy 5756 was not mandatory; since then multiple school districts, most recently Edison, have repealed it, to outcry from some LGBTQ+ groups and the NJ ACLU.\n\nA Monmouth County Superior Court judge \n\n, preventing Middletown schools from enforcing its policy until the courts can decide its lawfulness.\n\nAll five candidates answered the question in last week's forum, and all five candidates said they support parental notification. However, Mark Soporowski told Patch afterwards that he, like Wright, does not agree with Middletown passing its own amended response to the state.\n\n\"It was a rush job. I 100 percent support parental notification, but I totally disagree with how they went about it,\" said Soporowski, referring to the current school board. \"Because we are now stuck with this policy until it's settled in court. Whereas other districts removed it and had no pushback from the state. I don't agree with all the billable hours that are being accrued by our counsel.\"\n\nAs per the district's insurance policy, Middletown has to pay its lawyers, Cleary, Giacobbe, Alfieri & Jacobs, a $15,000 deductible to fight all lawsuits filed against the district, this one included.\n\nBoard vice president Jacqueline Tobacco helped write Middletown's transgender student policy; she has long defended it. When asked Wednesday to respond, Tobacco said the following:\n\n\"Mrs. Wright's misrepresentation about the financial implications of our lawsuit are troubling, as she is fully aware that our insurance policy covers the cost to defend ourselves against this unjust litigation. The only person spending taxpayer dollars on this lawsuit is Gov. Murphy,\" said Tobacco. \"It is unfortunate that Mrs. Wright betrayed the parents of Middletown by being the lone vote against amending 5756 and that Mr. Soporowski stated he would have voted with Mrs. Wright in support of Platkin and Murphy’s assault on Middletown parents and this Board of Education.\"\n\n\"Murphy is the one wasting taxpayer dollars on a frivolous lawsuit,\" continued Tobacco. \"Wright suggesting sitting down with Platkin is comical as he has ignored, for over a year, our repeated requests to meet in person to discuss what objections the state has to our amendments.\" \n\nWright did not respond to further questions on this topic from Patch, nor did she respond to Tobacco.\n\n (June 2023)\n\n (August 2023)\n\nJust days after the state sued Middletown, Marlboro and Manalapan school districts, the Colts Neck Board of Education held off on passing a similar transgender policy for fear of being sued by the state: \n\n (June 2023)\n\nHere is \n\n, which is still pending in the courts.

I use that path to walk to work. I work at the Joliet YMCA on Houbolt Road. I walk that path a couple times a week.\n\n\"That day, was an ordinary day for me. I came up to the pedestrian crossing that's at Black Road that is just west of the library, just before the I-55 overpass ... Cars stopped for me to cross the road. On the westbound lane, cars stopped. There was a green car in the eastbound lane that stopped for me and I proceeded to walk across the street,\" Piskur recalled.\n\n\"At that time, I didn't know that that black car was going to rear end the green car, and that green car hit me as I crossed that walk,\" Piskur shared with the City Council. \"I don't know what happened. All I heard was this loud bang and next thing I know, I am laying on my right side on the curb, trying to catch my breath. I couldn't breathe at the time.\"\n\nPiskur said that another motorist stopped to render aid to Piskur.\n\n\"So, taken to the hospital. No major problems except for we found out that I had a torn rotator cuff a few weeks later and in December I had surgery for that,\" he remarked. \n\nDuring the next several months, Piskur said he took the time to do a little more walking and more exploring of the Will County Forest Preserves.\n\nAt the Lake Renwick Forest Preserve along Airport Road in Plainfield, Piskur said, \"And I saw this. I call it a pedestrian light, crossing light. And I started thinking to myself, why can't the forest preserve put something like that there because Black Road is a very busy road, day and night.\"\n\nPiskur told the City Council that in May, he attended a Will County Forest Preserve Board meeting \"and shared my story with them. They said that there was really nothing that they could do as a forest preserve because that crosses a city street. And they said that I would probably be best off if I called the city of Joliet.\"\n\nPiskur said he called the city of Joliet and left a few messages, but then found himself busy with his summer camps that he oversees at the YMCA. Then, just a couple weeks ago, Piskur was driving along Black Road when he noticed the \"Stop Here For Pedestrians\" sign has been removed.\n\n\"So now there is very little signage for motorists to know that there is a crosswalk there,\" Piskur explained. \"I made a few phone calls with the city. They didn't really get anywhere. And then I called my Councilman, Mr. (Pat) Mudron, and left a message for him and I called Councilwoman (Jan) Quillman and actually talked to her for like 20 minutes and said, 'What was going on? Why was that sign removed?'\" \n\nMudron returned his phone call and they talked for another 20 minutes \"about the situation. And he knows about that crosswalk and how dangerous it can be. And he said the reason why the sign was removed because it was a false sense of security for pedestrians. If one car stops, they all stop, which I know that doesn't happen.\"\n\nIn closing, Piskur asked the City Council to look at putting \"some type of pedestrian light there. Or, at any other busy crossings to help people. I've never heard of anybody getting into an accident there or losing a life, but I would hate to see that happen now. It's something that I'm passionate about. I still go cross there two or three times a week as I go to work. And I've noticed that people do stop and some people don't stop. I'm just asking the city to look into it to see what we can do to make safer for everybody that's out there.\"\n\nAfter Piskur finished making his remarks, Councilwoman Sherri Reardon spoke up.\n\n\"We've had numerous conversations about that crosswalk and exactly what Mr. Mudron said was this false sense of security for the pedestrians ... It was so dangerous,\" Reardon told everyone. \"We've talked about the possibility of putting in an intersection, like on Jefferson Street, it's like by the Walmart, I think it's Joyce Road there, where there's a halfway point. We've talked about numerous things. We really have been trying to get something done about that situation.\"\n\nAfter Reardon finished her comments, Piskur urged Reardon not to pursue the idea of replicating what the city has on Jefferson Street. \n\nHe prefers a pedestrian crossing light at Black Road. \n\n\"I think a light would be something that motorists could see visually, other than a sign with a bicycle on it, that's three feet away from the crosswalk,\" Piskur suggested. \n\n"},

He said a community survey showed that residents considered indoor spaces far more needed. \n\nUntil a couple of years ago, the district had no gymnasium space. It has since bought the old Redeemer Center on St. Charles Road, which includes an elementary school-sized gym, Rogers said. \n\n\"We are so deficient in indoor spaces,\" Rogers said. \n\nAs for outdoors, the district has 36 rectangular fields and 27 baseball fields. \n\nIf the referendum passes, the district would spend some of the money on a bandshell at Wilder Park. \n\nThe district has held programs such as concerts, movies in the parks and other performances for much of the last century, Rogers said. But they have occurred on temporary stages. \n\nAlso, the district would use the money to build permanent restrooms at Crestview and Eldridge parks, the bandshell at Wilder and along the Prairie Path.\n\n\"We learned there was a saying in the Elmhurst Running Club: 'If you have to use the restroom and you're on the Prairie Path in Elmhurst, where do you go?'

Murphy suffered from postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder, an anxiety illness afflicting new moms that can cause unwanted and distressing thoughts about harming their baby. \n\nMurphy's illness led her to the Connecticut chapter of \n\n, a not-for-profit organization with the mission to promote awareness, prevention, and treatment of perinatal mental health challenges.

PSI-CT's \"Beyond the Blues\" program teaches the perinatal health professionals what to look for, and what steps to take if they feel like a referral is needed.\n\nPSI-CT has a roster of about 200 members, mostly mental health professionals like Murphy.

Doing so for the rest of the street would cost up to $2 million.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Village Board took the first step toward setting up a tax district – officially known as a \"special service area\" – for the four blocks. \n\nUnder the plan, those residents would pay back the $2 million over a decade, though officials stressed that was the uppermost amount. That works out to $5,300 a year for the average house on the street, not including interest. \n\nThe houses are worth millions of dollars. Patch checked 15 of their tax assessments, with the values ranging from $1.2 million to $3.5 million. \n\nAt Tuesday's board meeting, Village President Tom Cauley said the makeup of the district was driven by the residents themselves. He said all 38 properties should be included. Eliminating any of them, he said, would mean others' tax burdens would rise. \n\n\"The last thing you want in a situation like this is pitting resident against resident, so I try to avoid that,\" Cauley said. \n\nBill Haarlow, a Sixth Street resident, told the board some residents did not want to be part of the tax district. \n\nHe said their reasons include philosophical objections to the village not paying for it and that they don't have driveways on Sixth. \n\n\"These are the homes we have come up with based on who owns property on Sixth Street,\" Haarlow said. \"We feel you benefit from the street if you have property on Sixth Street.\"\n\nNo one showed up at Tuesday's meeting to oppose the tax district.\n\nFollowing state law, the village has set a public hearing on the tax district for Dec. 17.

It seemed that everyone else in Oak Lawn had the same idea because every space in Petey’s parking lot was taken\n\nSince the supper club’s owner and head chef — Petey Kattos, 92 — announced his retirement a few weeks ago, the dining room has been fully booked through the restaurant’s last day of its storied run, which is Tuesday, Oct. 15.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, I managed to squeeze into the packed bar, where everyone seemed to know each other’s name and gathered one last time to socialize at the bungalow. I snagged a table and ordered my highball because somehow the occasion seemed to call for an old-school cocktail. \n\nA server, who I had met outside a few minutes earlier, warned me not to go into the kitchen where Kattos was cooking.\n\n“He’s overwhelmed by everyone dropping in to say goodbye. He can’t keep up,” she told me. “He keeps ordering everyone out of the kitchen and saying he’s old.”\n\nLater, she brought me a cup of chicken noodle soup and Petey’s famous garlic bread in the bar. \n\nThe Greek-born Kattos \n\n home across the street from Advocate Christ Medical Center that had recently been converted into a lounge. After years of cooking at a Western Avenue eatery, he decided to put his skills to the test at his own venture.\n\n“I originally started cooking Italian food, even though I knew nothing about it,” Kattos told Patch in a \n\n. “But I just followed everyone else’s lead, and I caught on quickly.”\n\nAt first, it was slow-going, but Kattos along with his wife, Mary, dedicated themselves to providing their patrons with a hearty and traditional dining experience.\n\n“One day after we had opened, I saw a returning customer pull up near the restaurant,” Kattos said in 2011. “I raced from the kitchen and greeted him by name as he left his car. He was flattered that I had not only remembered his name, but also how he liked his steak cooked.”\n\nOver the decades, Petey’s became an Oak Lawn destination where area residents went to celebrate a 20th wedding anniversary, make a business deal, meet up with cronies or merely stop by after work to drink something brown. \n\nOccasionally, Petey’s would make it into Sneed or one of the other big news columns, where the occasional celebrity was spotted dining, and newly paroled public officials came to commiserate. \n\nNo dinner at Petey’s was served without the prerequisite relish tray of scallions, carrot and celery sticks, olives and red pickled beets. The prime filet sandwich served on toasted garlic bread is still a meal memory that I cherish.\n\nLast year, Kattos’ beloved Mary died and a piece of him went missing. So on Oct. 4, Kattos announced he was retiring and that the bungalow was closing, according to the \n\n on the restaurant’s website:\n\nAs of Oct. 12, the family announced that an increasing number of Petey’s menus and other personal property has gone missing since the announcement of the restaurant’s closing. They’d like the items returned.\n\nI finished my highball and soup and walked sadly into the dining room for one last look around. Hanging near the entrance of the kitchen, I had a clear view of Kattos cooking. I snapped a few photos of the master at work. \n\n“I wouldn’t go in there,” said a busser hustling into the dining room.\n\nThe legacy of Petey’s Bungalow Lounge lives in all of us.\n\n"},

That statistic isn't a comfort to those of us who have suffered losses. ", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/brick/club-no-one-wants-join-marking-pregnancy-loss-awareness-month", "article": "Over my lifetime, I have belonged to many clubs. High school clubs, Girl Scouts, PTA, the local soccer club and an animal rescue. They were clubs I willingly joined. I paid dues. I donned a whistle. I cuddled kittens that needed homes. \n\nThen there's the club that chose me. It's not one I wanted to belong to. In fact, I never gave it much thought before I joined. But it is without question one of the most influential clubs in my life. \n\nTwenty-two years after I joined, I still wish I didn't belong. \n\nIt was a pleasant September day in 2002 when I was recruited. We were a year removed from the terrorist attacks of 9-11, and while the mood of the nation was somber, I was distracted by the happy feelings I had of a new life growing within that I knew would complete our family perfectly. \n\nThen the unthinkable happened. I began spotting blood. The life inside me was in trouble. We went to the hospital. There was the baby, 8 weeks gestation, waving, its heart beating strong and sure. I felt relief. I went home with instructions to rest. I laid in bed and tried not to worry but the bleeding worsened. Panic set in.\n\nBack to the hospital. Another ultrasound. The stoic look on the technician's face and the monitor whose screen I could not see said it all: That life was no more.\n\nThe doctor's words echoed in my head. \"The fetus is no longer viable.\" \n\nI went back to work a few days later, to keep myself too busy to think about the emptiness in my heart. This happens sometimes, the doctors told me. Give it a few months and then you can try again. My family and friends -- everyone knew I was expecting again, because I'd had no reason to expect anything but good -- offered their condolences, and l moved on. Losing a baby was painful, but I was over 35. The risks were greater. I knew that. I had a beautiful child who loved and needed me, so surely this wasn't the end of the road. \n\nFall turned to winter, and as we cruised toward spring I got pregnant again. It was different this time. I was less sure, less calm. We told our parents, but no one else. I took extra precautions to get more rest. Easter morning dawned. I was at peace. 8 weeks and I felt good. It was good to be pregnant on a day synonymous with rebirth and happiness. I basked in the warmth of a family morning, our daughter on the bed digging through her Easter basket, my husband watching her, half-awake. \n\nA trip to the bathroom shattered that idyllic moment. Tears streamed down my face as I mouthed the words to my husband: “I’m bleeding.”\n\nAn hour later I was in the emergency room. Why was this happening again? I was trying to be stoic so as not to scare our daughter, who didn't understand why Mommy was going to the hospital. She went to my brother's house to have Easter with her cousins. My father and bonus mom came to the hospital. So did my in-laws. We made small talk. No one knew what to say to me. They did what they thought was best. \"Let it go and move on.\" \"It must have been for the best.\" \"There must have been something wrong with the baby.\"\n\n\"This happens sometimes,\" the doctor said. His eyes widened when I snapped at him. \"No, it doesn't,\" I responded angrily. “Not twice in a row.” After the first miscarriage, I had researched and read everything I could get my hands on that talked about miscarriage. I knew that repeat losses -- even just two in a row -- were indicative of a problem, especially at my age. I insisted they take a tissue sample for analysis. I demanded they get in touch with my obstetrician. And I didn't take no for an answer. \n\nOne in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, according to \n\n. In many cases, a miscarriage is an anomaly and women go on to have healthy pregnancies. In other cases, women find themselves thrust into the heartbreak of recurrent miscarriage – two or more pregnancy losses in a row. Fewer than 5 percent of women experience this, according to ACOG.\n\nI was in the latter group. In total I lost five much-wanted pregnancies, and my doctors were never able to determine the cause. \n\nThe hardest part was when I tried to talk about what I was feeling, no one was comfortable with hearing my grief. Even the therapist I went to — for one session — blew me off. \"Your life isn't that tough,\" she said. \n\nI quit trying to talk for a very long time. \n\nThe third, fourth and fifth losses were not as traumatic as the second miscarriage. It reached a point where I could feel a shift in my hormones, each time shortly after the 8-week mark, and I knew the end was coming. While I hoped each time that the pregnancy would continue — and did everything in my power to ensure it, from high-level testing to daily heparin shots — they certainly compounded the grief because no one could tell me why it was happening. \n\nWe finally stopped trying after the fifth loss. I was nearing 40 years old and began thinking about the practicalities of starting with an infant at that age. So in addition to grieving the pregnancy losses, I was grieving the loss of the dreams I had for my family. \n\nIt's been 18 years since the last loss in February 2006, but I still think about the babies who could have been. I think about the milestones – first days of school, graduations, proms — we would have experienced. I think about how my family would have looked, the kind of sibling my daughter would have been, how we would have managed all that life throws at a family. \n\nI would say I’ve made peace with it, but it wouldn’t be entirely true. You always wonder “what if”. That was certainly a thought that went through my mind in 2013, when I was coaching a boys soccer team, and out of the blue it hit me that the boys were the same age as the children would have been had I not suffered the first two miscarriages. \n\nWhile medical advancements have helped doctors learn more about the possible causes of miscarriage, society still is extremely uncomfortable with grief surrounding pregnancy. For so many years pregnancy was portrayed with glowing happiness, in spite of the fact that it is a complicated and sometimes fragile process. \n\nThe scary part is that I was lucky, and I know it: I have one lovely, healthy child, who I carried to term. It made my miscarriages more confounding, but I have her. There are many women who suffer these losses and aren't so fortunate. I can only imagine the pain they feel. \n\nI think that's part of why so many women grieve their miscarriages in silence. It’s hard to explain the heartache that goes with one of the ultimate betrayals by your body when it seems like everyone else gives birth without a hitch. \n\nThat’s why I am sharing my experience – so others don’t feel so alone in their grief. \n\nOne important note: While I’ve primarily addressed my thoughts to the women who’ve experienced this loss, there are plenty of men who grieve their partner’s miscarriages as well. I can’t speak to that experience, but I know my husband suffered, too.\n\nMost people think of October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but it also is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Month. October 15th is designated for remembering them, with everyone urged to light at candle at 7 p.m. — for the baby you've lost, for the one lost by your sister, your mother, your best friend. \n\nIf you want to help someone who's suffered a pregnancy loss, the best thing you can do is listen. Don't offer advice. Don’t say “it’s for the best,” because that is not comforting. Don't offer suggestions of what went wrong, because they prey on a woman's worst fears. Just listen, let her know you love her, and that you're sorry she's in so much pain.\n\nThat's the best way to remember the lost little ones ... and the best way to help the mothers who've joined this club against their will. \n\nIf you're part of this club, please know that you're in my heart, and I pray you find peace and the answers that I could not find.\n\n"},

The brand is also readying to open three new locations this year — two in Greenwich and one in Stamford.\n\nGreen & Tonic said it will continue to prioritize plant-based foods, but it will also add items like wild-caught salmon, organic chicken, and pasture-raised eggs to the menu to accommodate a flexitarian diet. \n\nFor example, pasture-raised egg sandwiches will be on the menu, and hard-boiled eggs will be added to salad stations. Chicken will be available as a salad station option, or included in a plant-based meal or grab-and-go item.\n\nGreen & Tonic was established in 2012 in Darien, and the brand has expanded over the years. \n\nThe menu is 100 percent gluten-free and features scratch-made, in-house offerings like salads, toasts, grain bowls, cold-pressed juices, breakfast sandwiches, smoothies and acai bowls. Signature offerings include Supr Brew Coffee (organic coffee drinks and lattes) and SWIRL, a dairy-free, oat milk soft serve. \n\nGreen & Tonic also offers meal plans, cleanses and catering services.\n\nThe new concept will be rolled out gradually beginning in late October, according to CEO Fausto Mieres.\n\nAs the new menu comes online at Green & Tonic's existing locations in Cos Cob, Darien, Westport, New Canaan, and Rye Brook and Chappaqua, N.Y., Mieres is preparing to open three more storefronts in Fairfield County.\n\nThe Glenville location at 21 Glen Ridge Road is expected to open toward the end of November/early December, Mieres said. \n\nThe Old Greenwich location at 239 Sound Beach Ave. will open toward the end of 2024, Mieres noted. The store will be the brand's biggest, with over 30 seats inside and a full menu.\n\nA storefront in Stamford at 54 West Park Place will open in mid-November, and \n\n, a sister store to Green & Tonic at 205 Boston Post Road in Darien, is slated right now to open toward the end of 2024.\n\nThe latest menu expansion came after Green & Tonic received feedback from customers looking for more non-vegan options. Green & Tonic sent out a survey to gauge interest, and the response was positive, Mieres said.\n\n\"We want to be more inclusive. Our goal is health and wellness, so we're always going to lead with that,\" Mieres told Patch in a recent interview. \"Our goal is to provide customers with the best ingredients available and to never cut corners. This is an exciting step for Green & Tonic. We feel we're moving forward and being more flexible for those who have different dietary needs.\"\n\nMieres reiterated that Green & Tonic will remain committed to a plant-based approach, as plants provide essential nutrients, support gut health, and contribute to environmental sustainability. \n\n\"None of the menu items are going away. We're not replacing anything. If anything, we're going to be adding more plant-based items to offset anything we add that's not vegan,\" Mieres said, estimating that the menu will be 95 to 98 percent vegan.\n\nStorefronts were closed recently and staff members received training on the new concept. Mieres said Green & Tonic will use separate utensils and pans when preparing food.\n\n\"We'll never cook a non-plant-based item with a plant-based item, or have them in the same container, or we won't use the same utensil. We want everyone to feel comfortable, so we're taking those precautions,\" Mieres said. \n\nWith the new menu and new locations set to open soon, Mieres said it's an exciting time for the brand.\n\n\"We keep growing, we keep seeing an increase in business, and people are choosing to eat better nowadays,\" Mieres said. \"We've been doing this for a while, and it's good to be a part of it and support everyone in their healthy journey.\"\n\nFollow Green & Tonic on Instagram for updates and more at \n\n.\n\n"},

His fourth trial 10 years later ended in a mistrial. His father, John Gotti Sr., was a mobster known as the \"Dapper Don\" and the \"Teflon Don.\"\n\nHe died in prison in 2002 while serving out a sentence for \n\n.\n\nIn a statement to Patch, Donnelly's office said \"the case against\" the two women was dismissed \"on procedural grounds.\"\n\n\"We await the judge’s written decision and will review our options,\" the statement concluded.\n\nJudge David Goodsell published his decision this week, a spokeswoman for the DA's office said Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released through the DA's press office, prosecutors said they are reviewing the decision.\n\nGoodsell determined the case should be dismissed due to violations of discovery requirements, \n\n previously reported.\n\nChristiansen and his colleague, Howard Beach attorney Gerard Marrone, who is representing Gianna Gotti, said the DA's office did not turn over evidence for their defense promptly, and did not disclose that the complainant had a previous conviction for stealing money from a car dealership, according to the outlet.\n\nProsecutors disputed the lapse in sharing evidence, saying that the victim did not tell them about the conviction.\n\nDonnelly's office did not comment any further on the matter.\n\nThe prosecution has 30 days to appeal the judge's decision.\n\nChristiansen said Goodsell's two-page decision upheld the application to dismiss the charges, and that he is confident it's the end of the criminal aspect of the case.\n\nThe DA's office is going to examine the decision's language to see if \"they're capable of using any specific language as a linchpin for their appeal,\" he said, adding, \"But I don't see any of that.\"\n\nIt depends on how the DA's office will react to the judge's decision, and whether there will be another \"chapter to this saga,\" according to Christiansen.\n\nWhile the criminal case was pending, the complainant hired prominent civil rights attorney Fredrick K. Brewington of Hempstead.\n\nBrewington declined to specifically comment on Christiansen's statements.\n\nHe did say that he and his clients are disappointed at the news and they are \"evaluating all of their options.\"\n\n\"We'll wait to hear what happens with regard to the criminal matter that is currently being reviewed by the District Attorney's office,\" he added.\n\nIn a court document obtained by Newsday, Marrone said the complainant's conviction was something that was \"at best hiding in plain sight.\n\nChristiansen said he learned about the conviction within days of being hired.\n\nHe opined that if he had identified a witness as his \"star witness that he intended to rely on at trial,\" he could \"guarantee\" that the DA's office would have \"undergone due diligence to discover a prior criminal conviction.\"\n\n\"They didn't do that in this case, and that was one of many objections we had to their declaration that they have undertaken their due diligence to turn over all discoverable evidence,\" he added.\n\nChristiansen said that the revelation about the complainant was \"one of many discovery deficits,\" in the case, noting that there's a deadline by which the prosecution must turn over all discovery before they can announce they are ready for trial.\n\nThe DA's office turned over their discovery early, but the motion challenged their readiness based on a multitude of reasons, according to Christiansen.\n\nThe attorneys claimed the complaint against the Gottis was insufficient, and that there were \"numerous discovery deficits,\" which included that there were \"additional materials, information, and documentation that had not been turned over,\" and would make their readiness for trial ineffective, he said.\n\nChristiansen said that in video, it can be seen how the fight was initiated.\n\nIn a videotape of the basketball game, the complainant can be seen getting up out of her seat, and \"contrary\" to a statement she submitted in support of a complaint, walking down, then walking out of the bleacher, down the aisle, and standing two steps above the gym floor, initiating \"a verbal dispute between Kimberly and she,\" he maintained.\n\nHer husband stood to her immediate left as she's facing the gym floor, as Kimberly was on the gym floor facing her, and the complainant alleges Kimberly struck her on the left side of her face with her right hand, but that was \"virtually impossible\" based upon the posturing of where everyone was — her husband was to her immediate right, according to Christiansen.\n\n\"What the video does show is the complainant initiating, escalating this from a verbal conflict to a physical conflict by initiating an initial punch with her right hand to the top of Kimberly's head, which triggered the whole melee,\" he said. \"And, in fact, in her mug shot, Kimberly is bearing a scratch on the top left side of her forehead.\"\n\nChristiansen said that he will have to wait to see how the judge words his decision to see if there is a basis for the prosecution to appeal.\n\n\"Judges don't dismiss cases for no reason,\" he said. \"They dismiss cases when the law requires them to do so. And, Judge Goodsell, he's a scholarly and tenured judge, and I have every faith that his decision will be well-reasoned and would hold up on appeal.\"\n\nKimberly did not appear in court for the proceeding last week because of some \"personal issues\" she was having, said Christiansen, who added that he did not speak with her immediately after the recent court proceeding.\n\n\"I related my congratulations and well wishes through her husband, John, to relate to her, and I'll just wait for her to contact me to have that conversation,\" he said.\n\nAs far as the case being over, Christiansen could not say.\n\nChristiansen hopes the dismissal of the charges is \"the last chapter of this saga.\"\n\n\"If there's going to be another one, it's going to be initiated by the complainant,\" he said. \"The Gottis never initiated any of this, not the fight, not the arrest, not the prosecution, but as of today, they ended all three.

We wanted to build something that has a deeper meaning than just a cannabis dispensary.”\n\nAt RUUTED, the dispensary offers products ranging from edibles to lotions to cannabis-infused chocolate. Customers can choose from a variety of flavors, and can even buy accessories like ashtrays and grinders. \n\nAccording to Ifergan, offering unique products is part of what makes RUUTED different from other dispensaries in the state. \n\n“I don’t want to turn into a dispensary that just sells vapes all the time,” Ifergan said. “I want to focus on educating people, and having the space almost act as a hub where people can come, ask questions, and get the support they need.”\n\nWhile Ifergan himself is from the North Jersey area, he said that RUUTED chose to open in Englishtown for a few reasons. \n\nFor one, Ifergan said he wanted to open somewhere that didn't have too many dispensaries. Second, Ifergan said RUUTED is aiming to target a bit of a different consumer demographic than other cannabis shops. \n\n“We want to serve more elderly people or older groups,” Ifergan said. “A lot of people serve younger kids, but we want to focus more on customer service and education about cannabis for people that maybe smoked in the 1970s and 80s but stopped because it was illegal.”\n\nNow that cannabis has been \n\n, Ifergan said he wants to help older consumers learn what kinds of products they like and help them see what cannabis can do for them.\n\n“The market has changed a lot, as well as the possible consumption methods and products,” Ifergan said. “We really wanted to cater to people that don’t know as much about it [cannabis] anymore.”\n\nAs part of that catering, Ifergan said RUUTED has focused on offering cannabis products that provide alternatives to smoking and contain health benefits. Edibles, products low in THC, and lotions that help relieve minor aches and pains are just a few examples.\n\n“Some people in older age groups are a little cautious about inhaling smoke,” Ifergan said. “It burns them, it makes them cough. So we focus on good-quality edibles, products we tailor for people who have problems falling asleep or staying asleep — we want to focus on people who don’t want to smoke as well as those who do.”\n\nMore than anything, Ifergan said he wants RUUTED to be a space for community and cannabis education. \n\n“The dispensary’s space is open, it’s inviting — so it’s really more of an intimate experience we want to provide,” Ifergan said. “Some people ask us questions and we're patient people, we always answer.

Considering that most areas of the districts in question across the state are developed with existing property there are questions about how much new multi-family housing development will actually take place in the short term.\n\n\"It's been a very contentious and acrimonious issue in a number of cities and towns — particularly the smaller towns at town meetings,\" said Peabody Mayor Ted Bettencourt, referencing Milton's ongoing court battle after the state sued the town following its refusal to abide by the law. \"That has a much deeper meeting beyond what this specific MBTA Communities Act is. I think it's going to be a determination that is going to help in terms of (determining) city and town rights to govern their own cities and towns rather than state enforcement.\"\n\nBettencourt said it was important to move toward meeting the requirements \"because there is a lot at stake in terms of potential grant opportunities and funding.\"\n\nGov. Maura Healey this week announced an additional $15 million in state funding for housing and infrastructure for only the cities and towns in compliance with the MBTA Communities Act. About half of the 130 classified MBTA communities are considered compliant with the zoning requirements with about a dozen deciding either to defy the mandate or delay their decisions until the Milton case plays out in front of the state Supreme Judicial Court.\n\n\"A coalition of Democrats and Republicans passed the MBTA Communities Law, and it's my job to enforce it,\" \n\n in response to the Marblehead Select Board's decision not to bring the zoning changes before a special town meeting by the compliance deadline after they failed to pass at the annual town meeting this past spring. \"Compliance with the law is mandatory, and this law is an essential tool to address our housing crisis, which sadly is leading to more and more residents leaving Massachusetts.\"\n\nCities and towns could lose access to millions in state grant funding for climate and transportation projects by being out of compliance, with state officials saying that additional litigation could be forthcoming against the communities to force compliance even if they agreed to forego the grant \n\nfunding.\n\nPeabody City Councilor Tom Rossignoll called the law \"deplorable legislation\" and said, \"We have to draw a line in the sand somewhere and this is where I am willing to draw it\" in opposing the compliance.\"\n\nCity Council President Stephanie Peach said that while she also considers it a \"gross overstep by the state\" it would also be \"grossly irresponsible\" for the City Council to put the state money at stake in jeopardy out of spite.\n\n\"I think we are all hoping this plays out in court and that this is ruled an overstep by the state and we don't have to do this,\" Peach said. \"I am not willing to risk the amount of funding we receive from the state by not complying. I wish we were in a position (to do that). But if we put ourselves in that position it's going to be a very difficult budget year and we're going to see significant tax increases — more than we're looking at just on a baseline right now.\"\n\nCity Councilor Peter McGinn also questioned whether the allowance of by-right multi-family production at market rates could result in Peabody falling below the 10 percent affordable housing threshold that allows it to block \"40B developments\" that are exempt from many local zoning requirements.\n\n\"Two different state mandates that are going to cause us to fall below our 10 percent and lose any safe harbor we have against 40B,\" McGinn said. \"That's outrageous.\"\n\n\"I think that was the intent,\" Bettencourt responded. \"I think that very thing that you just outlined is one of the state goals so cities and towns can't (block housing developments). \n\n\"That's the conclusion that could easily be drawn.\"\n\n"},

While the tunnel has been repaired frequently, its age and damaged condition present reliability concerns for more than 200,000 people who travel through the tunnel on more than 400 trains every weekday.\n\nIn addition to building a new train tunnel from New Jersey to New York, the plan also includes rehabbing the existing two-track North River Tunnel, building new Portal North and South Bridges over the Hackensack River in New Jersey, and making several other smaller upgrades between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station.\n\nThe nonprofit Regional Plan Association pointed out in an April report that paying for the Gateway Program is no small feat. \n\n.\n\nThe overall cost of the Gateway Program \n\n according to a recent White House fact sheet, significantly higher than earlier estimates of $16 billion. However, the price tag is well worth it, supporters say, including U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who \n\n to express his support for the project.\n\nThe Gateway Program was greenlighted during the administration of former President Barack Obama. It \n\n when Donald Trump took office. But it has \n\n, and has seen several key milestones since then.\n\nLast summer, the governors of New York and New Jersey signed a written agreement that guarantees a 50-50 split when it comes to funding Gateway. \n\nGov. Murphy and Gov. Hochul said they would work to “aggressively” chase more federal funding through President Joe Biden's landmark infrastructure package. \n\nThose efforts appear to have been paying off. In the past few years, several major infusions of federal dollars for the Gateway Program have been announced.\n\n“There is substantial construction progress on the nation's most urgent infrastructure project on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, on the New York side, and in the river itself,” said Stephen Sigmund, chief of public outreach at the GDC.\n\nAccording to the GDC, some recent construction milestones that have been reached over the past month include:\n\n"},

The Will County State's Attorney's Office prosecution team consisted of Christopher Koch, James Zanayad and Ashley Kwasneski. \n\n\"My daughter is finally going to have justice along with my granddaughter, finally, after four years, \" remarked Shirley Onderisin, 65, of Lockport, outside the Will County Courthouse during a Joliet Patch Facebook Live interview. \"We're so happy, not happy because they're gone, but finally, anyway, justice is served and I want to thank the Lockport police. They were a terrific part of this. I put my trust in them a lot.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the jury deliberated from noon to 10 p.m. without reaching a unanimous decision. On Friday, the jury resumed deliberations at 9 a.m. and the verdict was read around 2:30 p.m. In addition to being represented by Chicago criminal defense attorney Michael Clancy, Maggio's defense team also included Margaret V. McQuaid of the Law Office of Margaret V. McQuaid.\n\n\"I was very worried, very worried,\" Onderisin told Joliet Patch. \"But the evidence was there. I did a lot of praying.\" As far as the Lockport police detectives, \"They always kept in contact with me. And with them and the prosecution team, they were really good ... I did a lot of praying.\"\n\nMaggio's sentencing was set for late December. \n\n\"You know, he's going to suffer for a while, and I'm going to suffer until I die,\" Onderisin said. \"Because my babies will never be here with me again. But his dad can go visit him.\"\n\nAs far as the murders of the Lockport woman's adult daughter and baby granddaughter, \"Why? Why?\" Onderisin asked. \"It was so senseless. I mean, why did he do this? He could have been living a good life. We all could have been living a good life. Now he's got to sit in prison for the rest of his and I don't have my babies...\" \n\nThe former paramedic at the Joliet Amazon warehouse stood trial these past two weeks in the courtroom of Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak for the Oct. 2, 2020 slayings of infant Hazel Bryant and Hazel's mother, Ashtin Eaton.\n\nThe mother and little girl were found dead on inside their apartment near downtown Lockport in the 900 block of Hamilton Street. Eaton died of strangulation, and Hazel was found smothered on her mother's bed.\n\nMaggio was Hazel's father, and he and Eaton had carried out a romance after meeting at Amazon, where they worked together. Eaton was divorced, and she had another daughter, Jessica, who was 11 years old when her mother and baby sister were killed. Jessica, who was in sixth grade at the time, was not harmed by the assailant.\n\nThe Will County State's Office led by prosecutor Christopher Koch argued that Maggio killed Eaton and his little girl to avoid being required to make court-ordered child support payments to the divorced Lockport mother.\n\nAt the time of the slayings, Maggio lived in Crestwood with his fiancee and they have two small girls. By all accounts, Maggio's criminal defense lawyer Michael Clancey told the jury, Maggio had disowned Hazel. Clancy ejected the prosecution's theory that Maggio killed the Lockport woman and their child over a dispute about child support payments.\n\nEvidence presented by the prosecution showed that Maggio's DNA was found underneath both sets of fingernail clippings taken from Eaton at the time of her autopsy. Maggio's DNA was also found on the handle of the box cutter knife left near Eaton's slain body on her kitchen floor. Maggio's DNA was also found near the collar of Eaton's T-shirt at the time of her homicide.\n\nClancy argued that Maggio was home, sleeping in bed with his fiancé, in Crestwood, 30 minutes away from Lockport, on the night of the slayings. Clancy reminded the jury that the Lockport Police Department was unable to find any eyewitnesses, neighbors of Eato, or any video surveillance cameras obtained from local businesses or any of the suburban license plate reader video technology that would have put his client's car or Maggio's fiancée's car in Lockport around the time of the murders.\n\nEvidence reviewed by Lockport police indicated that Maggio's cell phone remained in Crestwood during the night of the killings. \n\nThe jury reached its verdict Friday afternoon after \n\nMaggio will be sentenced on Dec. 19.\n\n"},

She described the school's athletic director, Art Ostrow, as the roadblock. \n\nIllinois High School Association records show that the other conference teams – even South's sister, Hinsdale Central – have girls wrestling coaches.\n\nOne other thing separates Hinsdale South from the other 13 schools: It has the lowest enrollment. \n\nCentral is nearly twice South's size. The second-smallest school has 200 more students, while others schools in the conference – Lyons Township, Leyden and Morton – have thousands more.\n\nEnrollment makes a difference. \n\n, activities and sports. \n\nTo equalize the enrollments of South and the wealthier Central, the school board could shift the attendance boundary.

Listing examples, she referred to the types of buses and equipment that boys get compared to girls. \n\nShe said the athletics programs could generate more income by charging for admission for the girls sports that have no fees now. \n\n\"One of Mr. Ostrow's favorite things to say is 'it's not in the budget,'\" Kiefer said. \"But it would be reasonable if he ever tried to get funds for women's sports, but he doesn't.\"\n\nShe concluded, \"We will no longer stand for being brushed off as any other minor inconvenience.\"\n\nCallie Carr said she joined the girls flag football team this year.

Eventually, she decided to make the dream a reality, and on May 8, 2024, \n\n (named after the famous Bada Bing Club from “\n\n”), was born. \n\n“It just felt to me, naturally, that it was time to take everything I love and create my dream space,” Franklin said. “So instead of training in other people’s spaces, I’ve traveled around, gone to different pole studios, and created what I would love to see a dream pole and aerial studio be.” \n\nAt Bada Bling Fitness, the studio offers premier pole, floor, chair, and aerial dance training. No experience is required, and Franklin said she wants the studio to be a welcoming place for anyone who may be interested.\n\nThough Bada Bling officially opened in May, Franklin said there were still plenty of challenges the studio had to overcome on the way to their grand opening. \n\n“Obviously, there are connotations with pole dancing,” Franklin said. “People confuse us with a strip club opening in the plaza, which confuses me. What strip club opens in a mall?” \n\nThough Franklin wasn’t offended by residents confusing Bada Bling for a strip club, she said the confusion led to hostility from community members and people online. As plans for the studio were underway, Franklin said a photo of her in a split position was brought to a town hall meeting and publicly criticized. \n\n“It [the photo] was brought to Town Hall saying how inappropriate it was, and how it was not a good look for the town and for me,” Franklin said. “But it was an extreme flexibility move I’ve been trying to get for three years. I’m so proud of it.” \n\nThough misconceptions about Bada Bling continued online, Franklin said she tries to take advantage of any confusion to “kill the negativity with kindness.”\n\n“Anytime I see people get confused, I take the opportunity to be like ‘Hey, thank you so much for noticing we’re open. I’d like to clear up some misconceptions,’” Franklin said. “And I’ll tell them ‘This is me. This is what we do, and this is what we offer.

", "link": "https://patch.com/new-york/brentwood-central-islip/li-couple-rebuilds-halloween-light-show-after-holiday-hack", "article": "ISLIP, NY — Kevin and Kristy O'Reilly love the holidays. \n\nThey love it so much that they utilized Kevin’s background as a DJ and electrician to turn their Islip home on Bates Street into a dazzling Christmas display in 2018. The show was such a hit with the community, that they expanded by adding a Halloween light spectacular “to the mix” in 2019. \n\nFor three more years, Halloween and Christmas on Bates Street were straight out of a holiday movie. \n\nHundreds of people came from near and far to gaze at the lights. Families smiled for photos out front. Children were in awe and filled with wonder each time they drove by the house. The O'Reilly’s Christmas display won the local competition one year, and they even kept the holiday spirit alive through the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n“In 2020, we were proud to be able to provide a show and give people a place to go and have fun even during a pandemic,\" Kevin said.\n\nThen came the 2022 season and everything changed when computer hackers literally stole the show. \n\nKevin remembers it vividly.\n\n“It was the end of August and I was settling into my office to finish off some of the programming for the upcoming season and when the computer turned on I found a note on the screen,” Kevin told Patch. “Basically what it said was, ‘You have been hacked. We have encrypted everything on your computer.’ And if I wanted it back, I would have to pay them $5000 in Bitcoin.”\n\nBut there was more. The hackers racked up $25000 worth of credit card charges on Amazon, delivered the items to various locations, and hacked the Bates Street Light Display’s Facebook page.\n\n\"And just like that, in the blink of an eye, I lost six years' worth of programming. This was devastating, to say the least,\" Kevin recalled. \"I went into total panic mode because we were only four weeks from doing our 2022 Halloween show.\"\n\nBut the O’Reillys found the strength—and the spirit—to pull through.\n\n\"I don't know how I did it but I built a brand new computer and had to replace all the network equipment in my home, costing us thousands of dollars that I planned on using to make some long-wanted upgrades to the show.”\n\nKevin remembers “somehow managing” to put together a few songs and some lights to put on a Halloween display. \n\nBut it wasn’t easy. \n\n“I was so hurt and mentally drained. Why would someone do this to me? We didn't do a Christmas show that year. And to be honest, I felt so violated and broken,” he said. “I tried to get a show going for 2023, but I had lost all the desire and love of doing it because of how hurt I was. After not doing any shows in 2023, I was kind of disappointed in myself. I felt like I let the entire community down.”\n\nFor Kevin, the light show isn’t just a hobby—it’s a work of art and a labor of love that’s about sharing the holiday spirit. \n\n\"When I was a kid one of my favorite things to do was to get in the car with my parents and drive around looking at all the great lights displays,\" he said. \"Back then there were so many houses that decorated. You could go every night and drive through countless neighborhoods. Obviously, shows like mine didn't exist yet because the technology wasn't really there yet.\"\n\nSo after a short break spent recovering from the blow, Kevin and Kristy decided to light up Bates Street once again. \n\n“In January of 2024, I said to my wife, ‘I have to push through and dig down and find the spark I had before.’ It was a long road with a lot of long nights staying up till two or three in the morning, but all the hard work paid off,” Kevin said. \n\nAnd “hard work” isn’t an exaggeration. Kevin said programming the lights and music takes anywhere from 8 to 12 hours of computer time per minute of music. In addition, he custom-builds props, crafts thousands of lights into a beautiful display, and choreographs and synchronizes music with the props.\n\nOn Sept 10., the O’Reillys started setting up for the 2024 Halloween display. After a “long month of work” and a lot of late nights, the Bates Street Halloween show lit up on Oct. 9. and runs through Halloween. \n\nThose with young children don’t need to worry—the Bates Street display keeps it family-friendly, avoiding gore, blood and scary images. \n\nWhile their Christmas display won’t be up and running this year, Kevin and Kristy plan to bring it back in 2025 and they can’t wait to see the smiles on visitor’s faces. \n\n“Seeing all of you and all the kids having fun is what drives me to outdo myself year after year,” Kevin said.\n\nThe show will run every night until Halloween night from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays at 32 Bates Street in Islip. \n\nThe O'Reilly's light show can be found on Instagram at \n\n.\n\n"},

But village officials said the developers submitted their initial proposal to staff before the \n\n was passed, so it does not apply.\n\nParis-based mall owner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, or URW, and Chicago-based partner Focus Development pledged to set aside 3.5 percent of homes in the project as affordable for the first 25 years. That comes out to \n\n among the 425 to be built in the first phase.\n\n\"I know, Focus, you didn’t have to do it, but you did provide some inclusionary housing options for our residents,\" Trustee Keith Robinson said ahead of the board's 6-1 votes in favor of the plan. \"You heard and saw the spirit of our desire.\" \n\n\"Even if it’s 3.5 percent, I appreciate it,\" Robinson said. \"And I hope more people appreciate it.\"\n\nFocus Executive Vice President for Development Justin Pelej said the project was initially planned with zero affordable units.\n\n\"So the 3.5 [percent], to be honest, it's a complete economic issue,\" Pelej said. \"We run the numbers, we have to make sure this deal is financeable, it gets built, and we're at that threshold at 3.5 percent.\"\n\nThe lone vote against the project, Trustee James Johnson, failed to garner any support on the board for a requirement to increase the number of units or require a cash payment into a fund to support affordable units.\n\n\"Our inclusionary policy already has some of the most minimal requirements of any inclusionary housing policy in the country. It is already a pretty weak ordinance, and so meeting its requirements is not too much to ask, especially from a multi-billion dollar multinational corporation like Westfield, in my opinion,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson suggested village staff had done too much to help with the plans to redevelop its largest sales tax producer, including facilitating meeting between board members and executives from URW and Focus.\n\n\"The board, I would argue, publicly lied by labeling the shopping center as a blighted area in order to add an additional 1 percent sales tax at the mall and allow Westfield to take an additional $80 million or more from consumers to help fund this luxury redevelopment,\" he said. \n\n\"I strongly believe that if we are going to go to such great lengths to support Westfield and, in many ways, act more like a business partner than a regulatory body,\" he said, \"I think that Westfield should absolutely have to comply with the really minimal affordable housing requirements in our policy.\"\n\nTrustee Alison Pure-Slovin, herself a registered lobbyist with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said there was nothing untoward about meeting with representatives of the developers at Village Hall while considering the project.\n\n\"That's how politics work,\" Pure-Slovin said. \n\n\"I lobby in Springfield on behalf of an organization that I work for. I go into the offices of the legislators. It's not illegal to lobby or to give information through lobbyists in any way, shape, or form, which is what you were suggesting,\" she told Johnson.\n\nMayor George Van Dusen said village trustees would be legally liable if they rejected the proposal because it did not meet the new affordable housing requirements.\n\n\"If we turn down this project because we don't agree with the affordable housing component, it's not that Westfield can walk away, Westfield can sue us, and we would lose,\" Van Dusen said.\n\n\"Take note of that: we will lose, because you cannot compel a petitioner to comply with something that is not in law,\" the mayor added.\n\n\"They politely skirted it and didn't say it, but they are not legally bound to have a single unit of affordable housing,\" he said. \"And that's all we've talked about tonight is affordable housing.\"\n\nVan Dusen claimed that Skokie currently has the highest proportion of affordable units in the region at nearly 22 percent, correctly pointing out it is more affordable than its lakefront neighbors in Evanston.\n\nBut in fact, the village trails many other northern suburbs like Mount Prospect, Grayslake, Lindenhurst, Elk Grove Village, Norridge, Palatine, Gurnee, Mundelein, Niles, Rolling Meadows, Prospect Heights, Des Plaines and Wheeling, among others, according to the Illinois Housing Development Authority's \n\n. \n\nAmong the eight other towns in the area that have inclusionary housing laws on the books, the number of affordable homes has only increased in half of them, the mayor said. Meanwhile, all but one of the 14 suburbs without inclusionary zoning ordinances have shown an increase in the number of affordable units, he said, without noting that communities with plenty of affordable housing do not tend to pass laws to mandate more of it.\n\n\"Maybe they're telling us something,\" he said. \"Inclusionary zoning is not a magic wand.\"\n\n"},

Luckily, a Main Line couple has spent roughly the last year creating a solution for families who are in need of a babysitter.\n\nThis week, Ashley and Michael Clark, of Bryn Mawr launched their app \n\n, an acronym representing \"Find A Sitter Today.\"\n\nThe app serves as a sort of Uber or Lyft for babysitters along the Main Line. Families who sign on as FAST users can see in real time local sitters who are available for work, just like the popular rideshare apps.\n\n\"The goal is to immediately help people,\" Michael said.\n\nTheir third child, now 2, was born in 2022 and placed on a waitlist for daycare, the same one their other two children (ages 7 and 4) attend.\n\n\"I had a revolving door of Villanova students,\" Ashley said. \"Every morning in mid-August in 2023 we'd have cancelations. I was ugly crying to Mike, asking, 'what is going on?'\"\n\nThey searched for an app that would help connect them with reputable sitters locally, but found little to no resources.\n\nAfter a few weeks, Michael, 39, and Ashley, 38, took matters into their own hands.\n\nThe Clarks teamed up with an app development company based in India, but whose CEO spends much of his time in the U.S., working with them to create an app that is user-friendly to both babysitters and families.\n\nSome families might balk at the idea of using such a streamlined service to get quick childcare coverage.\n\nBut, the Clarks told Patch safety was a top concern in developing the app.\n\nThey said parents and guardians who join the app get verified by submitting identification, and prospective sitters receive new background checks via the app.\n\n\"Accounts get a flag with any blemishes,\" Ashley Clark said.\n\nEven small issues such as parking tickets and traffic violations are caught via the background checks, which are administered by Checkr.\n\nThe Clarks said conducting new background checks was paramount as the app came together. While some sitters hoping to join the service may want to provide previously obtain checks, the Clarks said that allows for too many variables, from outdated information to potentially fudged records.\n\nAnd, the app itself pays for the checks, meaning hopeful babysitters don't have to foot the bill.\n\nPotential sitters are also interviewed via Zoom.\n\nAnyone interested in booking an interview can do so \n\nOver the last nine months, the Clarks and Dr. Kirby Lynn Wycoff, Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling and Behavioral Health and Director of the Community and Trauma Counseling Program at Thomas Jefferson University, manually onboarded dozens of sitters.\n\nThese onboarded sitters were given access to the app late last week in anticipation of its launch for families Monday.\n\nNow, however, the vetting process and background checks are all done via the app.\n\nJust about three days into the app's launch, the Clarks have surpassed 200 downloads and said four sitter bookings have already been made.\n\nAnd so far, the feedback has been great.\n\nFAST has nine five-star reviews on the Apple Store and has received positive commentary from parents. Its \n\n features user testimonials, as well.\n\nFAST sitters earn $24 per hour via the app, and parents pay $29 per hour. The $5 difference helps keep FAST up and running.\n\nAnd, FAST does not feature any subscriptions, meaning all bookings are paid à la carte.\n\nThe Clarks said FAST is dually beneficial: it provides Main Liners with supplemental income, while giving parents a crucial resource as child care costs increase nationally.\n\n\"We're hoping to provide the village,\" the Clarks said, referring to the adage that it takes a village to raise a child. \"Not everybody has the village.\"\n\nDespite the measures FAST takes to ensure safety for its user families, the Clarks said they expect new families might book a sitter while a parent or guardian is still home a few times to feel out the system.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee a family will have the same sitter, the Clarks hope families will find the service more than adequate to book a sitter to be alone with their kids.\n\nSo far, sitters on the app are largely women in their early 20s to early 30s. The Clarks said the Main Line is a great area for such an app, with numerous institutions of higher learning nearby. Still, some sitters on the app are parents themselves, nannies, and teachers. Even two men have been onboarded as sitters.\n\nMichael said they hope young people who move to the area for school and sign on as sitters can potentially act as ambassadors in their hometown areas, ideally spreading the app's reach to new markets.\n\nFor now, the service is offered along the Main Line, from Narberth to Devon.\n\n\"Like any aspiring venture, we have huge dreams,\" Michael said.\n\nFor now, the Clarks want to perfect the experience on the Main Line, however.\n\nFAST will be in a quality control period for the next several months, but so far no crashes have been reported by users on either end.\n\nFAST uses ZenDesk for its customer service needs, but Michael is directly sent customer service emails, giving a personal touch to a business aspect that is increasingly automated by chatbots and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe app is available for download \n\n. The Android version of the app is expected to go live on the Google Play Store in the next several days.\n\n"},

By 2018 the print and web publications included the Hoboken Reporter, Jersey City Reporter, the Bayonne Community News, and several others.\n\nA slew of local education stories appeared on the website from March through July, including \n\n with the byline Eleanor Vega.\n\nAccording to Vega's bio, she's \"a distinguished education journalist with over 15 years of experience, holding a Master's Degree in Education Policy from Columbia University. Her work focuses on educational reform, classroom technology, and equity...Eleanor's articles for the Hudson Reporter bridge education policy with real-world impacts...\" \n\nColumbia does offer \n\n But Patty Lamiell, the director of media relations for Teacher's College at Columbia, told Patch, \"Teachers College cannot confirm that any individual by the name of Eleanor Vega graduated from Teacher's College.\"\n\nVega's story on the Secaucus superintendent quotes both Mayor Michael Gonnelli and Board of Education President Kelli D'Addetta.\n\nThere's one problem — the quotes are \n\n obtained for a story by Carly Baldwin, a full-time editor for Patch. \n\nAnd according to D’Addetta, the quote was only given to Baldwin. \n\n\"To answer your question I did not speak to anyone [there],\" said D'Addetta, the Secaucus school board president, in an email to Baldwin in July, when asked by Baldwin whether she spoke to anyone from the Hudson Reporter. \n\nMayor Gonnelli said he couldn't recall speaking to a reporter named Eleanor Vega.\n\nSince Patch began asking questions in July, the byline for Vega's stories was changed to \"Sarah Rodriguez.\"\n\nIn fact, Eleanor Vega's name and bio no longer appear on the Reporter website, and Rodriguez's \n\n on the local education stories. \n\nEleanor Vega was credited with a story in \n\n about a Texas man being shot to death on the New Jersey Turnpike in Secaucus, which still appears with her byline on Newsbreak — a news aggregating site — but on Hudsonreporter.com, it now bears \n\n name instead.\n\nMore recently, Patch Field Editor Caren Lissner wrote a story for Hoboken Patch on Aug. 13 about the Hoboken public schools \n\n. The Patch story included a quote from 2nd Ward Councilwoman Tiffanie Fisher that was obtained during a phone interview. \n\nAn identical quote appeared in Sarah Rodriguez's \n\nthat appeared on the Hudson Reporter website a week later.\n\n\"I only gave that quote to you [Patch],\" Fisher said.\n\nBrandon Chamberlain, the general manager of Newspaper Media Group, said last month that the company no longer owns the website, and in fact, \"The domain was sold in February 2023 or near there.\"\n\nHe declined to say to whom the domain was sold, or the selling price. When asked, he said it was not sold to an AI company.\n\nUntil this month, NMG was listed in the staff box of a PDF version of the site that appears in the lower right of the page. When informed on Sept. 21 that the staff box still had NMG still listed, Chamberlain said he would have it removed.\n\nUntil recently, the staff box also listed three staff members who had been laid off in January 2023, including former reporter Jordan Coll and former editor Gene Ritchings.\n\nThat changed after Ritchings emailed an address for the Hudson Reporter in late August.\n\nPatch has reached out to every email address on HudsonReporter.com's \n\n — including an email for Jessica Lamiere, listed as the the editor — but her email bounced back. Patch received no response to an email to info@hudsonreporter or to an advertising manager, \n\nJournalists Daniel Israel and Jordan Coll, who were laid off by the Hudson Reporter in January 2023, have spent several months \n\n in Hudson County to raise awareness of the shutting of the Hudson Reporter, the loss of the paper's archives, and the dangers of replacing journalists with AI.\n\nIsrael had worked for the chain for three years when he was laid off via a phone call in January 2023, he said. He said he used to spend hours at town meetings for crucial issues like major developments, rather than solely relying on other outlets.\n\nSo far, he and Coll have convinced nine of Hudson County's city councils, as well as the \n\n, to pass a resolution this year memorializing the \"demise of the Hudson Reporter\" and honoring the chain's 40-year legacy.\n\nPart of the problem with AI-aggregated stories, Israel said, is, \"I don’t believe readers currently understand that this is written by AI. It’s concerning, misleading, and an affront to the truth and ethical journalistic standards.\"\n\nThis past spring, the city of Jersey City's council voted 8-0 to accept the resolution honoring the Reporter's legacy, \n\n\"We continue to raise awareness of the dangers of artificial intelligence replacing journalists in newsrooms at the public hearings for each measure,\" Israel\n\n.\n\nColl has been chronicling the byline changes on the Reporter website on social media.\n\nHe \n\n on June 14 that Eleanor Vega and another bylined reporter \"don't exist.\" He said he was trying to \"spotlighting the direct impact artificial intelligence played out in undermining the work of actual journalists!\"\n\nAmong other ramifications for Hudson County residents, Coll said, decades of past news stories on the Reporter website have become difficult to find.\n\n\"On top of that, at one point the website removed the decades-old digital archive of The Hudson Reporter and Bayonne Community News,\" Israel \n\n in July.\n\nSome of the Reporter's stories addressed aspects of \n\n not covered in depth elsewhere, such as a look at the mysterious death of political consultant Michael Galdieri. (The matter resurfaced \n\n.) \n\nIsrael and Coll said they're talking to legislators including Bayonne Assemblyman William Sampson about addressing the replacement of journalists with AI reporters.\n\nLast November, Sports Illustrated was criticized for using reporters who could not be traced, with apparently false photos and bios.\n\nThe website \n\n found that Sports Illustrated bylines such as \"Drew Ortiz\" were paired with photos that were for sale on an website \n\nWhen Coll and the rest of the editorial staff were laid off in 2023, they were \n\nDeparting sales manager Tish Krasyk \n\n at the time that the publishers \"made the decision to cease publication of all Hudson County publications effective immediately...I have worked with these publications for 27 years and have enjoyed every minute of it. The people of Hudson County are like nobody else.\"\n\nA reader left a comment underneath: \"Oh no. Where will I post my husband’s memorial every year for his anniversary. Sad great little paper.\"\n\nIn August, after Patch began asking questions, a new byline, Moses Lookman, appeared on local news stories on the site. \n\nLookman did not respond to an email address given for him on the site, but did respond when Patch reached out via LinkedIn. He said he was writing for the site but did not respond to more detailed questions.\n\n Currently, he is the only person credited with writing local news. Much of the content on the site has focused on sports, gambling, and cryptocurrency. \n\nSarah Rodriguez's byline appeared on a review in March of the dating website Ashley Madison, \n\n. \"It can connect you with an affair partner while offering advanced privacy features and absolute discretion,\" she noted.\n\nIt's still unclear who owns the site.

{"title": "Panhandling Discussions To Continue As Supervisors Defer Proposal", "description": "After a February directive to explore ways to address panhandling, supervisors deferred a proposal that includes a jobs program.", "link": "https://patch.com/virginia/woodbridge-va/panhandling-discussions-continue-supervisors-defer-proposal", "article": "WOODBRIDGE, VA — Discussions are continuing on how to address panhandling in Prince William County as the Board of County Supervisors deferred action on a funding proposal. \n\nIn February, the Board of County Supervisors had approved a directive from Supervisor Yesli Vega (R-Coles) to explore ordinance amendments addressing panhandling and public safety. The directive asked the county attorney's office to review options and other Virginia localities' ordinances to provide policy recommendations. As Inside Nova previously reported, \n\n for panhandling. \n\n due to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that panhandling is First Amendment protected.\n\nVega had also \n\n to regulate panhandling in traffic lanes while not violating First Amendment rights of panhandlers. Vega said in a letter to constituents that Supervisor Bob Weir (R-Gainesville) proposed a similar ordinance in August.\n\nSince the February directive, County Executive Chris Shorter created a Process Action Team that identified three main concerns with panhandling: public safety (including traffic safety, aggressive behavior and loitering), providing needed services (including homeless, mental health, substance abuse and employment services) and addressing negative perceptions. The team came up with three recommended strategies: a coordinated community safety response, public engagement and communication and pilot employment program with Keep Prince William Beautiful for litter control. \n\n was considering $550,000 to start implementing those three strategies. \n\n\"What we did was establish a process action team to take a look at this, to see what other jurisdictions were doing around this issue, what were some of the best practices for some of the things that's worked in other parts, not only in Virginia, but around the country...to try to reduce panhandling,\" said Elijah Johnson, a deputy county executive. \"We're not saying we're going to eliminate panhandling. I would be remiss to say that, but we want to implement things that are making an impact to start to address the issues, which would include some accountability things.\"\n\nSeveral supervisors noted that the response did not meet Vega's original directive. Vega said she was \"baffled over\" some of the proposals brought to the board.\n\n\"I was very clear and I was very direct in the directive that I issued,\" said Vega. \"And the directive said that I direct the county attorney's office to draft language for a defined ordinance which prohibits the exchange of objects in the right of way to present to this board for consideration. It was supported unanimously by all of my colleagues.\"\n\nVega noted \"the intent\" behind the proposal is good, but \"it's not ready for prime time.\"\n\n\"I think that if we come together collectively, we can put forth something that's going to be meaningful and that is actually going to address the goal from the very beginning, so we can be compassionate while, in my opinion, enacting common sense policies,\" said Vega. \n\nChair Deshundra Jefferson (D-at large) agreed that the proposal wasn't meeting the directive. \n\n\"For me, that's okay. I want to attack this problem on multiple fronts,\" said Jefferson. \"I do want to eventually get back to Supervisor Vega's directive. But this is a real issue, and there are so many reasons why we've come to this problem. There's not one thing that's driving this.\" \n\n\"I think we need to start somewhere, because it's getting worse,\" said Supervisor Andrea Bailey (D-Potomac). \"People are suffering, people are hungry, people are trying to figure out how they can survive.\"\n\nSupervisor Margaret Franklin (D-Woodbridge) sought to defer the proposal to give time to the newly-formed county \n\n to make recommendations. \n\n\"It just got set up. They've had a few sessions already, but I think we should go back to the drawing board and allow them to use the on-the-ground, grassroots experts that they have to really delve into this issue the same way they're going to delve into other issues, the traffic issue, the mental health issue,\" said Franklin. \"We specifically talked about panhandling being part of that discussion.\"\n\nWeir said proposed ordinances to address the traffic safety side of panhandling haven't been discussed publicly, and he intends to introduce an ordinance at the board's Oct. 22 meeting. \n\nSome supervisors stressed the need to get county messaging on panhandling out soon. \n\nSupervisor Tom Gordy (R-Brentsville) suggested considering the communications part of the funding immediately, but the county executive called for time for county staff to develop it as a standalone proposal. \n\n\"If we're going to take a multi-pronged approach to this and we're going to be successful, I think we need to be bold, and we need to invest in making sure we get this message out broadly, quickly and effectively as a county,\" said Gordy. \"Otherwise we could be spending money that just dies.\"\n\n\"I think at the very least, having that public facing communications piece now would do some impact,\" said Supervisor Kenny Boddye (D-Occoquan). \"Because every day that we don't have something out there that's saying, 'hey, you guys need to stop giving directly these folks at the street corner or on the median or in the shopping center, is another day that we're only exacerbating this problem. We're only letting that culture become more and more entrenched.\"\n\n"},

Crittle testified that he considered Maggio, who was employed as a paramedic, to be his supervisor.\n\nApproximately a month before Eaton was found slain on her kitchen floor in Lockport and her infant daughter Hazel smothered to death on her bed, Crittle had a conversation with Maggio that became the subject of Wednesday's case presented by Koch.\n\n\"I used to work with him at Amazon,\" Crittle told the jury. \"He was a supervisor at Amazon. We worked on the safety team together.\"\n\nWhen Crittle worked at Amazon, he drove a forklift and worked in the product receiving area. \n\nCrittle estimated that the conversation he had with Maggio happened about three to four weeks before the double murders, which happened on Oct. 2, 2020. About a half-dozen employees were gathered around, talking, during their cigarette break at an area of the warehouse known as the smoke shack, when Maggio called Crittle by his first name and asked about the idea of paying him $10,000 to make Ashtin Eaton disappear. \n\n\"We was outside in the smoke shack,\" Crittle testified. \"And we started laughing. I said, what, do I look like a criminal or something?\"\n\nAccording to Crittle, \"there was about five or six of us. He looked at me and said it.\"\n\nDuring cross-examination from Maggio's criminal defense lawyer Michael Clancy of Chicago, Crittle told the courtroom he considered Maggio's question about making Ashtin Eaton disappear a joke.\n\nCrittle testified he did not think Maggio was being serious at that time.\n\n\"You took it as a joke?\" Clancy inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" Crittle agreed. \n\nAs for Crittle, his employment at the Joliet Amazon warehouse ended in late 2020, he told Maggio's lawyer.\n\n\"I got fired. I was, they said, stealing time,\" Crittle testified. \"They said I was taking unnecessary breaks. Put it that way.\"\n\nHowever, Crittle acknowledged he was one of the \"certain people\" who knew that Maggio and Eaton \"had a little fling going on\" at the Amazon facility. \n\nDuring further questioning from prosecutor Christopher Koch, Crittle was asked if most of the smoke break conversations at Amazon involved conversations about sports, weekend activities and the \"women at Amazon.\" \n\n\"Women at Amazon? Yes,\" Crittle agreed. \n\nKoch also asked Crittle if he ever had conversations with other coworkers about the idea of being paid money to make one of their coworkers disappear.\n\n\"You were aware that Ashtin Eaton was alive at the time the statement was made?\" Koch inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" Crittle agreed.\n\n\"Do you commonly talk about people disappearing for money?\"\n\nClancy objected to Koch's question and Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak agreed, sustaining the objection, meaning Crittle did not answer the prosecution's question. \n\n\"You knew Ashtin and Anthony had some sort of relationship?\" Koch asked.\n\n\"Correct,\" he agreed. \n\nBefore dismissing the witness, Maggio's lawyer asked Crittle one last time for his interpretation of Maggio's question about making Eaton disappear for $10,000.\n\n\"I said I took it as a joke and everyone was taking it as a joke, yes.\"\n\nPaul Kish, one of the country's most renowned blood-stain analyst experts, was called to the witness stand on Wednesday morning as the final witness for the Will County State's Attorney's Office case against Maggio, now 30.\n\nKish presented the jury with a PowerPoint presentation analyzing the blood stains, spatter and pools of blood found inside 936 Hamilton St. near downtown Lockport, inside Eaton's apartment. Kush's presentation showed Eaton's body sprawled across her kitchen floor. Both of her hands were covered with her blood, and there was a large pool of blood near one of her feet.\n\nAccording to Kush, all the blood came from the Husky box cutter knife found near her body. Her left wrist was cut wide open, and the wound was nearly 3 inches long.\n\nKush's testimony marked the first time during the trial that the jury heard evidence that Eaton was still alive in the kitchen after suffering the knife wound to her wrist. Kush also suggested that Eaton and her assailant struggled on or near the floor of the kitchen; that was where most of the blood spatter was concentrated.\n\nMaggio's lawyer, Clancy, will begin presenting his case on Wednesday afternoon. \n\n"},

Burbidge of the Catholic Diocese of Arlington said he saw no need for Northern Virginia to have casinos, during Monday’s episode of The Walk Humbly Podcast.\n\nBurbidge told podcast co-host \n\nTom Shakely\n\nthat the church has tolerated “what have historically been called games of chance” such as cards, lotteries, friendly wagers and bingo.\n\n“But the Catechism states that games of chance become morally unacceptable when they deprive someone of what is necessary to provide for his needs and those of others,” he said. “We see the difference there. If you're having a friendly game of cards and you lose a quarter, it's not going to be that big of an impact. But if you're taking $500 or so to the casino and you end up losing it all, that $500 was supposed to be for other purposes. Now we can’t do what we’re supposed to do.”\n\n \n\nThe key point of the Catechism, which is the collected tenets and beliefs of the Catholic Church, was that the passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement and addiction was a threat to one’s freedom.\n\n“I'm only one voice, but I don't see the need for casinos in Northern Virginia,” he said. “That’s up to the community and elected officials to decide.”\n\nShakely, who is the diocese’s chief communications officer, intoduced the topic of casinos by mentioning Virginia Sen.

Cultural norms, being perceived as ‘weak’ or ‘crazy’ by the community, and shame can all act as barriers for people to seek help.

In those circumstances, we do not assume that a person has the skills to handle whatever they are dealing with or tell a person struggling with chest pain to ‘be strong’ or ‘not tell anyone.’\n\nIn addition to implementing culturally responsive training for its clinicians, Discovery hoped to reach out to the community through a joyful celebration. “Dandiya Nights, or Ras Garba nights, are held during the festival season in India, leading up to the celebration of Diwali. These gatherings take place in all types of large venues, where mutiple generations of families gather to participate in garba (rhythmic folk dance) and raas (done with 16\" wooden sticks called Dandiyas),” Bhandari explained. “We chose this holiday as the festival as it brings all people, young and old, together in community with one another.

This is a very different mission for us.\"\n\nMcHugh said Coburn first called him on Sept. 29 trying to find out if they could fly oxygen tanks to a nursing home near Woodruff, South Carolina, where Coburn's sister works for the police department. \n\nCoburn said his sister told him there was a serious need for the tanks because of elderly patients who needed oxygen and were unable to use electric machines that produced a constant flow of oxygen.\n\nBut some research raised issues, including that they would need a prescription to obtain the tanks, along with risks associated with carrying pressurized canisters at 7,000 feet in the air, McHugh said. \n\nWhen that wasn't viable, Coburn asked McHugh if they could fly gear to a sheriff's office near Woodruff, which had lost all of its personal protective equipment in the flooding. The Ocean County Sheriff's Office provided gear, McHugh said\n\nHe sent off an email to the 150 members of the Jersey Aero Club, looking for pilots willing to donate their time to fly. The club owns six planes that are for the use of its members, and McHugh volunteered them for the relief flights. \n\nCoburn posted his initial plea for donations shortly after, and the effort expanded from there. It's also changed quickly over the few short days since the first flights took off on Friday.\n\n Initial deliveries of supplies went straight to Asheville to an area where the main relief efforts are being coordinated. \n\nNow, McHugh said, \"we have been delivering plane loads for specific families.\"\n\nThey are in contact with church groups and community groups in isolated areas in four counties — Avery County, Ashe County, Elk River County and Jackson County — in North Carolina. Those groups relay specific needs and McHugh said volunteers at the airport fill the requests, placing the items on a pallet that is then weighed before loading a plane that then delivers the items to their connections on the ground and ultimately to the families in need. \n\nThey had 12 flights scheduled to depart Wednesday and have flights reserved every day through Oct. 19, McHugh said. \n\nIn one area the devastation is so bad that the people receiving the deliveries have to meet them on horseback, he said. \n\n\"It's kind of fun because we're really able to meet the people we're helping,\" McHugh said. \n\nIn the process of filling the needs, items that have been donated that have not been specifically on a wants list have been put in a 53-foot trailer for transportation to one of the generic distribution centers. \n\nMcHugh said that while they are pausing on accepting donations of supplies, they are still in need of volunteers to help sort the overwhelming amount of items at the airport. People who would like to help can go to the airport at 1900 Cedar Bridge Ave. in Lakewood any day this week during the hours the airport is open. \n\n\"We need volunteers at the airport to prep planes and sort items for pallets,\" he said. \n\nThey also are welcoming donations to help offset the fuel costs incurred by the pilots. Donations can be made by check payable to the Jersey Aero Club, by Venmo to the Jersey Aero Club or to Coburn's Cash App account for his business, Cole Home Construction. \n\n\"It's awesome seeing how this has transpired over the last six days,\" McHugh said. \"Cody's been a powerhouse.\"\n\n"},

The pot going into Wednesday’s drawing is $1,652,550 and is expected to exceed $1.7 million.\n\nPark Lawn’s progressive raffle has been rolling over since October 2022 which was the last time someone won. Five jokers, including one pulled last week, wiped out the board and a new game was started. Last week, a joker was drawn killing the board.\n\nThe \n\n has attracted thousands of players across the Chicago region, including a dedicated cadre of regulars who reserve half the bar at \n\n in for a chance to win the life changing, take-this-job-and-shove-it jackpot that has soared in recent weeks. \n\nIf the winner picks the queen and is present, he or she splits the jackpot 60-40; if not present, the winner splits the jackpot 50-50 with Park Lawn. \n\nThe game fell under the scrutiny of Village of Crestwood leadership when the jackpot reached $1 million in July after a joker was pulled, starting a new game with a clean board based on a deck of playing cards. \n\n“It’s for Park Lawn’s protection,” Mayor Ken Klein told Patch. “These guys sell tickets at several different outlets. What happens if someone takes some from where it’s sold?”\n\nPer the license issued to Park Lawn from the \n\n, the jackpot is capped at $2 million.\n\nKlein said there isn’t a cap and the village would have considered allowing Park Lawn to increase the jackpot of the current game to $4 million provided the charity takes out a bond. According to the village ordinance, a fidelity bond for any raffle or game of chance in the sum of $2 million or two times the aggregate value of prizes, whichever is less, “in favor of the license conditioned upon his or her honesty in the performance of his or her duties.”\n\nPark Lawn officials were hoping to continue the marathon Queen of Hearts Raffle up to $4 million. Klein said the bond was for Park Lawn’s own protection in case the money coming in from ticket sales, or a portion of it, was stolen.\n\n“We were okay, it’s a charity, but once above $2 million they need to protect themselves,” Klein told Patch. “The village doesn’t want to be responsible because we could be liable.”\n\nThe Crestwood mayor said he didn’t understand why the charity “didn’t go with a $20,000 bond.”\n\nIn order for Park Lawn to take out a bond, an individual associated with the charity must be personally responsible for it, such as a staff person or board member. Sources tell Patch that the Park Lawn board did not want to go with that option and decided instead to cap the jackpot at $2 million and have a drawdown until the queen is found. \n\nThe current progressive raffle, identified as version 7.0, will continue under the current rules, but should the queen be drawn before the jackpot reaches $2 million, the game will end immediately.\n\nIf the queen isn’t found and the jackpot hits $2 million, a “drawdown” will occur. Here’s how it works:\n\nIt could be a lengthy process that could take up to an hour-and-a-half. Each ticket pulled will win 24 free tickets for the new 8.0 version of the Park Lawn Queen of Hearts raffle. \n\nAfter the completion of the current 7.0 version of the game, tickets will go on sale immediately. The next version of the game will start at a date to be determined.\n\nTicket prices will remain the same if there is a drawdown: $5 for 6; $10 for 12; and $20 for 24. Online sales close at noon Monday, but ticket sales will continue at Park Lawn’s Oak Lawn office at 10833 S. LaPorte Ave., or at the always fun \n\n 4901 Cal-Sag Road, Crestwood, where the drawing is held at 7 p.m. Wednesday. \n\nPlayers must be 18 and older.

That's all I can say,\" Paul, 28, said. \"If I'm stressed, if I have an attitude, I will go dance on the train so that I can forget about it. It's a big stress reliever for me.\"\n\nFor Paul, performing on the subway is like a live-action business card — commuters who've seen him perform have booked him to dance in music videos and even \n\n with Emmy-nominated actor and producer Anthony Anderson, he said.\n\nHis dance routine changes from day to day, but it always includes a variety of moves from a style called Lite Feet, he said. \n\nLike break dancing, Lite Feet is an explosive, high-energy dance form that evolved alongside hip-hop. The main difference is the footwork — in Lite Feet, the quick footwork has a weightless quality.\n\nHowever, over the years, his routine has evolved to include more daring tricks on the poles and handrails because those make more money, he said. \n\n\"It's fun, it keeps me in shape, it makes people happy, but it's really about the money — I've got to make money,\" Paul, who is raising a toddler, said. \n\nFor the past 10 years, Paul has performed regularly with friends Nijul Jennings, Wilburt Smith, and Malik Hymes. \n\nHymes, a 28-year-old from East Flatbush, said they often dedicate their performances to their friends who have died.\n\n\"We do this for the brothers that are no longer here with us. We are still dancing and staying positive for y'all,\" Hymes told Patch.\n\nPaul said each dancer makes around $150 per day during the week and $300 per day during the weekend. Lately, the E train has been better for business, he said. A few times, he's even been handed a $100 bill. \n\n\"I used to like the L train a lot when I was younger, but as of right now, I dance on the E train every day, from Queens Plaza to Forest Hills and back,\" Paul, who recently moved to Far Rockaway, said.\n\nPaul has a rigorous schedule. He performs on the E train between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. daily, he said. After that, he picks up his toddler from preschool and then performs for another three hours on the L train between Bedford Avenue and First Avenue. \n\nFor his fellow performers, his work ethic is inspiring. \n\n\"He's a great leader. He knows how to lead and reach the goal he wants to reach,\" Hymes said about Paul.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, they've never kicked anyone in the face. \n\n\"Those guys are from the Bronx,\" Hyme said. \n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/elmhurst/elmhurst-rec-facilities-deficient-decades-official", "article": "ELMHURST, IL – An Elmhurst Park District official laid out Monday what a property tax hike would bring to the community. \n\n\"Quite frankly, this community has been deficient for decades in terms of recreational facilities as compared to other communities that the park district benchmarks itself against,\" Jim Rogers, the district's executive director, told the City Council.\n\nThe comparison towns include Naperville, Carol Stream. Glen Ellyn, Wheaton, Downers Grove and Woodridge, he said. \n\nIn the Nov. 5 election, Elmhurst voters are set to \n\n go $90 million into debt for improvements. \n\nThe property tax increase is projected to \n\n of a house valued at $500,000, which is close to Elmhurst's median. The tax is expected to last 25 years. \n\nOf the money, 95 percent is slated to go to replacing the Wagner Community Center, a project that is expected to cost $84 million. \n\nThe Wagner building at 615 West Ave. started as an elementary school in the 1950s. It was purchased by MacCormac Junior College in the mid-1980s, operating for a couple of decades as a college. \n\nIn 2004, the park district bought the building, converting it into a community center. \n\n\"It comes along with all the charm and features that you would expect of a 1950s elementary school,\" Rogers told the council. \"We have significant space constraints.\"\n\nWith a new recreation center, the community would have a walking and jogging track; courts for pickleball, basketball and volleyball; a multisport indoor artificial athletic field; and space for gymnastics, dance, early childhood activities and other programs, according to the district. \n\nRogers said most residents correctly see the Wagner building as serving children 12 and younger. \n\n\"We certainly don't have the space for more programming, although I do like to give the aside that we have a very successful adult dance program that takes place at the Wagner Center, a span of ages from 22 to 95,\" he said, adding that the 95-year-old joined the program 21 years ago. \n\nThe park district, Rogers said, is not seeking a tax increase because it's struggling financially. To the contrary, its books are in \"excellent\" shape, he said. \n\nThis year, the district opened Pick Park, which is \n\n, the only neighborhood west of Route 83. And by year's end, the park district aims \n\n at 0S761 Old York Road.\n\nRogers said the park district can handle those smaller projects with the help of state grants. But to go into debt by $90 million, the park district must get voters' consent, he said.\n\nNow, Elmhurst Park District's property tax rate is in the bottom third of DuPage County's park districts.

Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston) and Brad Schneider (D-Highland Park) issued statements reflecting on ongoing violences spreading across the Middle East and touching lives throughout Chicago and the suburbs.\n\nWhile Schneider's statement suggested the war will not end short of regime change in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Schakowsky emphasized the need for de-escalation to prevent a potential regional war.\n\nLast year's Hamas-led attacks killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage in the deadliest single day for Jews since the Holocaust and the largest number of Israeli military casualties since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\nThe following 12 months have seen the Israeli military carry out strikes in Gaza, assassinate its opposition's leadership in Beirut and Tehran, and this month, send forces into southern Lebanon, from which Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into northern Israel.\n\nAs violence continues to spread across multiple fronts, the Jewish community gathered at vigils in Northbrook, Highland Park and Skokie to mourn, honor the victims, and demand the release of the more than 100 hostages believed to remain in Gaza. \n\nAlthough their boundaries shifted slightly following the latest redistricting, studies have found the 9th and 10th congressional district of Illinois to have the largest numbers of Jewish adults in the state and among the top 15 in the nation. As of 2020, 12.2 percent of adults in the 9th District, which is represented by Schakowsky, were Jewish, as were 15.2 percent of those in the 10th District, which is represented by Schneider.\n\nSchneider, a co-founder of the bipartisan \n\n, said in his statement he was awoken by a call from his son around 6:30 a.m. on the day of the \"barbaric, genocidal attack,\" which had been underway for about eight hours.\n\n\"'Israel is at war, turn on the TV,'\" his son told him.\n\nSchneider said it was clear immediately that these attacks were more significant than previous ones during the 14-year Israeli blockade of the Hamas-led Gaza Strip.\n\n\"We soon realized that Israel was fighting an existential war against not only Hamas, but Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, and central to it all, the regime in Iran,\" he said.\n\n“In the days and months since, I have twice visited Israel to bear witness to the sites of the atrocities and have regularly met with survivors and their families to personally hear their stories.\"\n\nSchneider has worked with Republicans to make sure Israel, as the U.S.'s \"closest friend\" in the Middle East, has the resources to \"defend itself, secure its borders, protect its citizens, and return the hostages, including all Americans,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. has spent at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel in the past year, surpassing a previous record set in the late 1970s, according to a \n\nfrom Brown University.\n\n\"At the same time, I have met with people from our government, as well as from Israel, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and others, to ensure desperately needed humanitarian aid is delivered into and throughout Gaza for as long as it takes to defeat Hamas,\" he said.\n\nSchneider, who \n\n on Sunday evening, encouraged everyone in the community to honor those killed on Oct. 7 and remember those who sacrificed their lives to save others that day.\n\n“Let us also redouble our efforts to open a path, envisioned by the Abraham Accords, to a more secure and peaceful future for all the peoples of the Middle East—both Israelis and Arabs—free from the terror and nihilism of the Iranian regime and its proxies,\" he said. \"We all want the wars to soon end, but they will only end when those committed to peace stand up to and defeat those seeking nothing more than domination, death, and destruction.\"\n\nIsraeli officials said a total of 728 soldiers have been killed by hostile fire since Oct. 7, with another \n\n killed by friendly fire and accidents, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, has attributed nearly 42,000 deaths to Israeli military operations. And about 1,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel stepped up a campaign of airstrikes last month, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSchakowsky said her top priorities were to immediately bring the hostages home, end the violence for good and bring peace and justice to both Israelis and Palestinians. The last year, she said, has been unbearable. \n\n\"My heart aches for all those who were killed on October 7th and their loved ones who mourn their loss; for the hostages and their families who have endured an incomprehensible year of suffering, and in some cases, even death; and for the thousands of innocent Palestinian families caught in the ensuing war that have lost those dear to them, fleeing homes and communities turned to rubble, living in fear and struggling to survive,\" Schakowsky said.\n\n\"Just last month, the Chicago community came together following the devastating news that \n\n, a young man with a bright future ahead of him who was taken hostage by Hamas, was killed,\" she said, noting that \n\n are from Chicago and his grandmother and aunt are her constituents. \"They have endlessly stepped forward to make their voices heard, tell Hersh's story, and advocate for the safe return of every hostage.\"\n\nGolberg-Polin's family is expected to appear at a community memorial Monday in Skokie, along with Schakowsky and survivors from the Nova Music Festival — where more than 250 people were killed when Hamas gunmen attacked concert attendees. \n\n\"It is time for the Netanyahu government and Hamas leadership to reach a final deal. Right now, the Middle East is teetering on the brink of a catastrophic regional war that would put millions more in danger,\" Schakowsky said. \"The U.S. and our allies cannot allow this to happen.

But Newark’s program remains a “national model” of success, officials say.", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/newarknj/newark-confident-lead-pipe-replacement-program-despite-arrests", "article": "NEWARK, NJ — A company hired to replace lead pipes in Newark has been accused of running a scam on the city, federal authorities announced this week. But Newark’s program remains a “national model” for success, officials say.\n\nSeveral years ago, the City of Newark hired JAS Group Enterprise Inc. to replace lead pipes as part of its battle against water contamination. Instead, the company allegedly left some of them in the ground – and collected their payment anyway, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nTwo people at the company were arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. \n\nThe work in question was part of Newark’s Lead Service Line Replacement program, prosecutors said.\n\nFive years ago, Newark made national headlines when it confronted a lead water crisis. At one point, the lead levels at some points in the city’s drinking water had risen to 47 parts per billion at some sites, more than three times the federal threshold. It prompted an outcry from residents – and a lawsuit from advocates.\n\nNewark eventually identified two sources of the contamination. One was the way the city treated its water, which allowed excess corrosion to take place in aging pipes. The city responded by rolling out a new method of treating its water, which is also sold to several nearby towns and cities in Essex County.\n\nThe second issue wasn’t as quick of a fix, however.\n\nNewark officials traced some of the contamination to lead-lined service pipes leading to thousands of local homes. The pipes – which connect local homes and businesses to the local water supply – can potentially leach contamination as water passes through them. A portion of the pipes may be privately owned, complicating efforts to replace them.\n\nDespite the challenges and scope of the project, Newark has since replaced more than 20,000 lead service pipes, a massive effort that got a big thumbs up from officials including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut earlier this year, a new speedbump emerged.\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka and Shawn LaTourette, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), gave some background about the issue in a joint statement on Friday. They wrote:\n\n“In January 2024, Newark and the NJDEP were advised of concerns that, in some cases, third parties hired to replace lead service lines in Newark may not have complied with all requirements for full line replacement (example: from the water meter inside a home to the water main in the street). In response, Newark and the NJDEP initiated an audit to identify affected properties and commence inspections to verify compliance with lead service line replacement requirements to ensure the continued safety of all residents. \n\n“The audit, which began in January 2024, included both a targeted and a randomized data assessment resulting in over 700 excavations.\n\n“The targeted audit included 403 service line excavations. Of these, 33 properties were found to contain some remaining lead components, which were replaced. Consistent with Newark’s post-replacement protocol, residents were provided point-of-use filters for lead and flushing guidance by the city. The NJDEP is evaluating the randomized audit data set.\n\n“Importantly, the NJDEP has confirmed that Newark’s corrosion control treatment has been optimized to protect residents whose water may come into contact with plumbing that may still contain lead components. Newark has also demonstrated compliance with federal requirements. At this time, there is no need for Newark residents to take any additional precautions with respect to their drinking water.\n\n“Both the City of Newark and NJDEP’s leadership acted on these allegations as soon as we learned of them. We are proud that these investigations have led to arrests of individuals in connection with this matter, and justice will be done. We are also grateful to Newark residents who cooperated with the investigation, by allowing these excavations on their property.\n\n“Despite the indictment of these parties, the city and NJDEP remain confident in the success of the lead service line replacement program, which has led to 23,190 replacements, and stands as a national model for reducing the risks of lead exposure.”\n\nNewark city officials held a news conference about the arrests on Thursday afternoon. Watch the video below, or \n\n.\n\nBaraka said that the city was continually fixing any issues it came across during the investigation “on the spot,” adding that the corrosion control efforts – which are separate from the pipe replacement – added an extra layer of protection.\n\n“So there was no time that the residents in the city were in any danger whatsoever from having lead leech into their lines,” Baraka said.\n\n“I know everybody was asking us questions in the beginning, but we could not speak as freely as we are speaking now, because there was an investigation ongoing,” the mayor said. “So I'm glad – by the grace of God – that we've come to this point, that it is, in fact, over, and that we have responded the way we responded.”\n\n"},

The attacks killed more than twice as many Jews as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\"We continue to mourn those whose lives were taken, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Itai Seif, and others with ties to Highland Park,\" Rotering said. \"May their memories be for a blessing.\"\n\nGoldberg was the son of Chicago area natives who moved to the San Francisco Bay Area before emigrating to Israel. The 23-year-old was taken hostage while attending the Supernova music festival and held in captivity for nearly 11 months before being slain by his captors.\n\nSeif, who visited Highland Park as a high school student as part of our Youth Robotics Exchange, was a 24-year-old captain in the Israeli military who was killed by an explosive device during Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza.\n\nLast year's coordinated cross-border attacks in Southern Israel, led by the military wing of Palestinian group Hamas, claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people, \n\n of whom were civilians. \n\nThe internationally designated terrorist group captured \n\n, took them to the Gaza Strip and used them as hostages in an attempt to negotiate with the Israeli government.\n\nSince then, more than 100 were freed during a brief ceasefire last year, while fewer than 10 have been rescued alive by the Israeli military, whose forces fatally shot three hostages as they held white flags. More than 30 hostages are believed to be dead, six of whom are \n\n in a tunnel as Israeli forces approached.\n\n\"Over the past year, Highland Park has kept those held hostage and their loved ones in our hearts. Members of our community have hosted vigils, held rallies, visited and volunteered in Israel, and provided support to those directly impacted,\" Rotering said. \n\n\"At every City Council meeting since October 7,\" she said, \"our City Council and staff have remembered those held hostage and those whose lives have been lost, pausing before continuing our work to stand in solidarity with their families in Highland Park, Israel, and around the world.\"\n\nRotering cited analysis from the Anti-Defamation League indicating a dramatic rise in antisemitic incidents. According to the ADL, the number of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. tripled in the months following the Oct. 7 attacks. \n\nFollowing the attacks, the ADL modified the methodology of its audit of antisemitic incidents to expand the definition of antisemitism \"to include in the Audit certain expressions of opposition to Zionism.\" Protest chants like, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" or \"Hey hey, ho ho; Zionism has got to go,\" are now considered antisemitic, according to the \n\n.\n\nIn Highland Park, dozens of anti-Israel protestors picketed the private residence of Congressman Brad Schneider, a \n\n of the Jewish state. City staff said they reportedly chanted antisemitic comments, though they \n\n what was said. \n\nIn response, the City Council in August amended its regulations regarding demonstrations in residential areas. Under the \n\n, all protests in residential districts are banned unless they target buildings that are used as businesses, non-residential buildings, take place at public meetings or at the private homes of protestors themselves.\n\nCity officials will keep working with all levels of law enforcement to monitor \"regional and national trends,\" Rotering said.\n\n\"We are collectively implementing proactive measures to promote vigilance and public safety throughout our region by partnering with neighboring communities, who last fall joined Highland Park in condemning antisemitism and all acts of hate, on information-sharing, joint training, and shared public safety dispatch services,\" she added.\n\nCity staff said police are working to ensure safety throughout the weekend, which marks both the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks and Rosh Hashanah, the start of the Jewish High Holy Days. \n\nAnd although no specific threats have been identified, Highland Park police have increased surveillance at local houses of worship and heightened patrols citywide from Friday through Tuesday. \n\n\"May we all find renewed hope in the comfort of community,\" Rotering said. \"Wishing all who celebrate a sweet, healthy and peaceful new year.\"\n\n"},

On the beach. On the sand,” Greacen told Patch. \n\nGreacen now lives across the Intracoastal Waterway in Seminole on the water. \n\n“I was watching the water rise and panicking, and she’s kind of one-upping me, ‘Look how bad it is here,’ and then all hell broke loose,’” Greacen said. \n\nHelene’s strong storm surge broke through her sister’s hurricane-impact, sliding glass doors, smashing them “into a million pieces” and allowing water to flood the home, she said. \n\nPam and her brother-in-law escaped through a side window and swam to a neighbor’s house.\n\nWhile that home was also inundated by flood waters, it’s two stories, so they holed up upstairs during the remainder of the storm.\n\nAs Greacen lost contact with her sister she fretted about what she should or could do, so she created \n\n to help organize those who needed rescuing from flooded homes or who required some kind of assistance as the hurricane and its storm surge roared around them.\n\n“We lost our mom three years ago and it’s been hard. My sister and I are really close,” she said. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, I can’t have more loss.’ My heart was beating out of my chest. I couldn’t sleep.”\n\nAs she scrolled through Facebook, she was overwhelmed by the cries for help that she saw posted in various community groups. \n\n“‘Help me, I’m trapped. Help me, my home flooded,’” Greacen said. “I just thought, these are going to get buried by the morning. We need to consolidate a list and start tracking these people.”\n\nThough she eventually fell asleep, she woke up around 3 a.m. to a sticky post-storm heat, as her home lost power during the night. Her cell phone also died while she was sleeping. \n\nAfter charging it in her car, she was surprised to find when she turned her phone back on that 500 people had already joined her new group overnight. Within 48 hours, 2,100 people had joined, and as of Friday afternoon, a week after the hurricane, it boasts more than 2,600 members.\n\nGreacen immediately got to work the morning of Sept. 28, hours after Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm in the Big Bend area before tearing across the U.S. Southeast.\n\nWorking with local captains — most of them average citizens who just happen to be boating enthusiasts — they began organizing rescue missions, sending boats to the hardest-hit areas of the barrier islands to shuttle people seeking help back to the mainland. \n\nSome boats were sent with medical personnel to help with injuries and health-related issues while others sent those with veterinary experience to assist victims who they knew had pets.\n\nOn the Saturday after the storm alone, she organized 17 ongoing boat operations, she said. “And I’ve never met these people in person. I have no idea who these people are who are in my phone. We just all wanted to do something and before I knew it, I was running rescue operations. And I don’t know anything about emergency management.”\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, boaters offering their services through the group rescued more than 450 people and dozens of pets from Pinellas County’s ravaged beach communities, Liz Becker, who is helping Greacen organize the rescue missions, told Patch.\n\nGreacen’s own sister is among those rescued through her efforts, she added. \n\nThe rescues have mostly taken place from Redington Shores south to St. Pete Beach with a few in Clearwater, Becker said. \n\nThey were all in Zone A, which was deemed a mandatory evacuation area ahead of Helene. Because of this, Greacen stresses that all involved in the rescue efforts are “judgment free.”\n\n“There were a lot of elderly,” she said. “People think about the island and they think a lot of people have money. But, no, a lot of these people have lived there for 30 or 50 years and don’t have the resources to leave. And they’re sitting there when this hurricane comes through and they’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\n“Everyone was caught off guard,” boater Travis Hayes, who works for the U.S. Postal Service, told Patch. “People are quick to ask, ‘Why didn’t they evacuate?’ Sometimes they’ve lived there 50-plus years and they’ve never seen anything like this. When you can’t fathom it, you can’t fathom it; you can’t process it.”\n\nEvery rescue mission has been different. Sometimes, the person they’re sent to search for is fine, though maybe their cell phones died or their vehicles don’t work.\n\n“And they tell us they’re just going to ride it out; maybe they need a case of water,” Greacen said. \n\nOthers needed more medical attention, including hospitalization for broken bones or other issues. And some of the older storm survivors had dementia or memory issues and didn't want to leave. \n\n“Then, we’re like hostage negotiators,” she said.\n\nOne granddaughter connected with the group asking them to check on her grandmother, who didn’t want to leave her home. As rescuers spoke with the woman, her granddaughter had to call to convince her to go to the mainland. \n\n“It was like, ‘Grandma, get on that boat,’\" Greacen said.\n\nThe needs on the barrier islands have evolved in the week since Helene. \n\n“Friday (the day after the storm) was more taking people off the island. People and pets. Maybe they were huddled in their attics through the storm and they were just ready to get off,” Hayes said. “On Saturday, we were still taking people off, but also taking people to the island to see their homes and what kind of damage there was, and also bringing supplies.”\n\nThis included boatloads of generators to those without power.\n\n“We’re just trying to do our part to help,” Hayes said. “Whatever we can.”\n\nThe operations between the ravaged coastal communities and the mainland continue even after the barrier islands have reopened to residents, business owners and the public. Many roads remain impassable and neighborhoods are still without power, water and sewage. \n\nNow, the focus is mainly on connecting volunteers with those who need assistance clearing properties and homes, as well as bringing needed supplies to the island. \n\nThe group is accepting donations to bring to these communities, as well as fuel for the boat captains donating their time. While the boaters are primarily leaving from docks at The Angry Pepper, Bay Pines and Jungle Prada, donations can be dropped off at \n\n.\n\n“It’s been an incredible testament to this community. The work isn’t done,” Becker said. “We still need to take action. The speed and path that this group has been able to have, I’ve been in awe.”\n\nGreacen added, “It’s funny when a disaster happens, people find a way to organize and things like this just kind of happen. (Our Facebook group) gave people the resources they needed to help each other and it took on a life of its own. Everybody’s been great.”\n\n"},

She was 65.\n\nGrace, who played field hockey and softball for the Warriors before graduating in 1976, went on to play at Springfield College. She returned to her hometown as a teacher and coach, and experienced success virtually unmatched in Connecticut high school coaching history.\n\nShe spent 20 years in charge of the field hockey program, securing the school's first Class S title in 1985, a co-championship with North Central Connecticut Conference rival Granby Memorial. A year later, the Warriors won their first outright title with a 3-1 decision over Old Saybrook.\n\nThe decade of the1990s was particularly fruitful for Canton field hockey, as the school snared six Class S crowns between 1991 and 1999, including three in a row beginning in 1997.\n\nGrace stepped down from coaching following the2004 campaign, which concluded with a 3-1 loss to Granby in the title contest. Her teams had three state runner-up finishes in addition to their eight championships, and also earned 11 conference titles during that span. She retired from coaching with just under 300 victories.\n\nIn 2002, she was one of the inaugural honorees of the Canton Wall of Fame. She was inducted into the Connecticut Field Hockey Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Connecticut High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2012, and was named High School Coach of the Year by the Connecticut Sports Writers' Alliance in 1993. In 2000, she was a finalist for the Coach of the Year award by the National High School Athletic Coaches Association.\n\nHer success was not limited to field hockey. She coached Canton softball for 10 seasons, winning seven conference championships and the Class S crown in 1991. She also coached golf, and was one of the few female athletic directors in the area for about a half-dozen years in the mid-2000s. In addition, she was the Canton School District Teacher of the Year for 2012-13.\n\nSeveral contemporaries told Patch Grace was among the most fierce, competitive coaches with whom they had ever been associated, but unanimously said that she was as highly respected as a coach as anyone who ever patrolled the sidelines in the state.\n\n\"We had wicked battles on the field, like two monsters, but when the game was over, we'd be having a cup of coffee together,\" longtime Avon coach Terri Ziemnicki said. \"She expected you to be your best and helped you get there. She was someone you wanted to emulate.\"\n\nZiemnicki recalled occasions where her team bus pulled into the Canton High School driveway and the word \"Graceland\" was spray-painted on the hill.\n\n\"That was intimidating for visiting teams,\" she said. \"She taught me a lot, and I'm going to miss my pal.\"\n\nHall of Fame coach Dot Johnson of Granby played Canton twice a year in regular season NCCC competition, plus countless times in league and state tournament action.\n\n\"We had an intense rivalry on the field, but after many years, we got to know each other and got to be more friends than rival coaches,\" Johnson said. \n\nLegendary Enfield coach Cookie Bromage, who opposed Canton numerous times during her 52-year tenure at the helm of the Raiders, said, \"My heart is heavy, I'm so sad. She was a phenomenal friend who was fierce, competitive and brilliant. We would talk strategies on the phone and I would wind up taking notes. She loved her kids and got the most out of each one. She was a great coach, a great teacher and a marvelous and loyal friend.\"\n\n\"Our field hockey community has lost a legendary coach,\" former Somers coach and longtime CIAC tournament director Dawn O'Neil said. \"She was very competitive on the field, but a true friend off the field.\"\n\nCanton athletic director Kim Hirth said, \"Nancy was Canton. She invested so much of herself into teaching and coaching the Canton community, and she touched so many lives during her time here. I only knew her for a short time, but I felt like I knew her for my entire life, and that's a testament to the way she could connect with people. She will be missed greatly by our town and school, but she will never be forgotten.\"\n\nA Celebration of Life is being planned for late October, Ziemnicki said.\n\n"},

But for the past 28 years, there has been a side project in the works that has gained a fresh relevance as West Orange rolls out its new town-wide \n\n.\n\n“Our goal is to re-introduce as many native species of trees back to the area as were once abundant when much of the Pleasantdale area of West Orange was forested – before it was even farmland,” owner Wade Knowles said.\n\nKnowles said that Pleasantdale Château started adding trees as far back as the 1990s when his family first acquired the property, and the effort has been a “continual labor of love.”\n\n“We’re proud of the ecological diversity that we have – nearly A to Z – from American Lindens to Walnut trees,” Knowles enthused.\n\nWhile its guests have been partying, the château’s proprietors have been busy with renovations. One of them? A new “Arboretum Conservatory” – the result of a five-year plan to convert an existing unused structure on the estate into an additional multi-use event space to host indoor wedding ceremonies, public events and educational seminars.\n\nAfter getting approval from the West Orange Historical Preservation Commission, the Knowles family began renovations that included intricate traditional timber frame construction, “adaptive reuse” of existing materials and the sourcing of other natural materials that were hand-picked from Europe and beyond – all in an effort to stay true to the period architecture of the château.\n\nAfter completing construction on the conservatory, the Knowles family kicked off the next phase of their plan: surround it with a combination of mature old-growth trees and newly-returned species that were known to have existed in the West Orange area centuries ago. \n\nAs part of the arboretum project, the Knowles family have also added additional trees to practically every area of the property. Included among the plantings are the addition of new apple trees to its farm, expanding a small orchard that already includes pear, peach, plum and persimmon trees. \n\n“Many of the trees that we’ve successfully transplanted started their lives as nuts and seeds that we’ve grown in our greenhouse and continued as saplings in our farm fields,” Knowles said.\n\nPleasantdale Château also has another connection to the days of yore: an estate farm that dates as far back as 1835 and has been in continuous operation since the Knowles family took ownership of the property in 1995.\n\nThrough its several fields and greenhouses, the estate’s farm and grounds staff harvest thousands of pounds of produce each year (as well as honey from its bee hives) that the château’s culinary staff then incorporate in meals for guests of the estate.\n\nThe farm is also used to propagate many of the flowering plants that are on display throughout the estate, as well as inside of the château’s orangerie. This formal display greenhouse is also host to potted trees that produce calamondin oranges, ponderosa and Meyer lemons, as well as key limes.\n\nIncluded among the estate’s collection of flora are an over a century-old pair of rare Dutch elms, nine different varieties of magnolias (including one grown from the seeds of a tree in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, Italy), 10 species of oaks, a number of beautiful flowering redbuds, and countless others. Knowles’ efforts also include the restoration of the Northern spicebush (‘Lindera benzoin’) and pawpaw (‘Asimina triloba’), which were once plentiful in the region.\n\nKnowles said tree conservation has been a lifelong interest of his ever since he learned about the classification of tree species in his early teens. It’s a hobby that he has put to good use, identifying more than 60 different tree species on the estate so far – and marking them with placards for visitors.\n\n“We have some truly magnificent trees on the property that we’re often asked about, so this is a great way to help educate our guests about the wonderful diversity that we have here in northern New Jersey – and on our estate especially,” Knowles said.\n\nWhile there are currently no public tours of the estate available, local environmentalists can visit Pleasantdale Château’s website (pleasantdale.com) and join its mailing list to receive announcements of future public events.\n\nWant to know more about the history of Pleasantdale Château? Here’s some background info, courtesy of the Knowles family:\n\nThe Knowles family continued:\n\nThe Knowles family acquired the estate in 1995, with plans to “ensure that its elegance and rich history would remain intact.”\n\n"},

They've always been very accommodating.\"\n\nBut he said the district's three-person finance department can absorb the duties that the treasurer's office handles. \n\nThe district pays about $60,000 a year for the treasurer's office's services. If the district takes on the new duties, its new annual expenses consist of $20,000 for a financial management software license and $2,000 for the treasurer's surety bond, according to \n\n to the school board.\n\nUnder a new state law, any member district can withdraw from a treasurer's office with a two-thirds school board vote, the memo said. (The District 106 board has not voted yet.) The law also lets each participating district appoint a member to the treasurer's office's board. \n\nHowever, the treasurer's office's lawyer interprets the law as not applying to it, according to the memo. If the treasurer's office's interpretation is followed, District 106 would not be able to withdraw or appoint a board member. \n\nGetty, the treasurer, did not return messages for comment Thursday.\n\nIf this dispute goes to the courts, it could get costly for taxpayers.

She said it \"deeply saddened\" her but she was also \"extremely impressed\" by the response to it. \n\nA year after publishing the article, Hill filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court. He claimed that the resolution defamed him, that university officials broke their contract with him and interfered with professional opportunities.\n\nHill modified that complaint several times before a Cook County judge threw out three of the four counts it contained, leaving behind only an allegation of discrimination and harassment under the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n\nAssociate Judge James Snyder ruled that Hill is a public figure — he describes himself as a \"public intellectual\" and debates controversial topics as a DePaul professor — and that the statements in the resolution were essentially an opinion about his opinions. Legally, opinions cannot be defamatory.\n\nSnyder found Hill's claim that the resolution cost him unspecified, speculative professional opportunities by damaging his standing in the university community to be \"incomprehensible.\" \n\nAnd since the professor never suffered any change in the terms or conditions of his employment, the judge ruled that he cannot pursue a claim of employment discrimination.\n\nInstead of pursuing the one remaining count that Snyder did not toss out, Hill withdrew it and filed an appeal.\n\nOn Sept. 18, a three-judge appellate panel unanimously ruled against him, finding that \"no set of facts can be proven\" that would lead to him being awarded any money from university officials.\n\n\"As acknowledged at oral argument, Professor Hill remains a tenured professor at DePaul. He was not fired. He was not suspended. He was not demoted or reassigned. And his pay was not reduced,\" Justice Leroy Martin said in the \n\n. \"Professor Hill has pled no tangible loss, only amorphous speculation that his prospects are diminished.\"\n\nEven though Hill claims the resolution counts as a \"censure\" and DePaul denies it, the appellate panel found it did not matter, since censure alone does not count as a materially adverse employment action. \n\nThe court emphasized that the ruling was not taking a position on the merits of Hill's article or the Faculty Council's resolution.\n\nWhile Hill's initial article coincided with the formation of a right-wing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, campus demonstrations over the Israel-Gaza War reached a zenith earlier this spring.\n\nAt DePaul, pro-Palestinian student protestors \n\n a tent encampment, which remained at the university's North Side campus for more than two weeks before Chicago police \n\n it.\n\n"},

Semrad was again refused access to [him].\"\n\nAccording to the motion, Dillon told Semrad he could only speak to Crimo if the arrestee invoked his right to an attorney. \n\nAfter the interrogation was over, Crimo's interrogators gave him a written copy of the Miranda warnings, which he signed shortly after midnight.\n\nThe right to an attorney is protected by both the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Sec. 10 of the Illinois Constitution, and judges in Illinois have interpreted the right to counsel more broadly than federal law in certain cases.\n\nIn a major 1994 case called \n\n, an appellate court ruled that any waiver of the right to counsel is invalid if an attorney for a detainee arrives at an interrogation and is denied access.\n\nSpecifically, state law requires that if an attorney retained or appointed by a detainee's family arrives at the police station during an interrogation, the police must inform the person they are arrested that an attorney is present and wants to speak with them. \n\nIf the police fail to do so, any waiver of the right to counsel made by the defendant is not considered \"knowing and voluntary,\" because the arrestee lacks the crucial information that their lawyer is available to assist them. \n\nLake County State's Attorney Eric Rinehart, who, according to Trizna's motion, told Dillon via text message to notify Crimo that Semrad was in the lobby, issued a statement after Wednesday's hearing.\n\n\"We are continuing to prepare for the previously set trial date, February 24, 2025,\" Rinehart said. \"To prepare for trial, parties file motions to settle evidentiary and legal issues in advance.\"\n\nThe admissibility of a tape of Crimo's July 4 statement to investigators was also a key issue in the hearings ahead of his father's reckless conduct trial. \n\nIn that case, Assistant Public Defender Greg Ticsay argued that it should be sealed to protect Crimo's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. In the final hearing before the scheduled trial, the judge rejected that argument.\n\nLake County Associate Judge George Strickland said he would permit transcripts of the relevant portions of the interrogation to be included on the record, explaining that he would not allow \"\n\n.\" On the day the trial was due to begin, the accused shooter's father \n\n with prosecutors, who reduced the felony charges to misdemeanors.\n\nAccording to attorneys for both sides in that case, the recording of Crimo's interrogation includes a confession and \n\n, including his planning of the shooting, fleeing the scene dressed as a woman, where he had buried a cellphone in Wisconsin during the hours-long manhunt that followed what was, at the time, the deadliest mass shooting in state history.\n\nAmong the seven motions filed by the prosecution ahead of Crimo's trial next year are requests to include as evidence recordings from cloud-based security cameras at the home Crimo shared with his father, as well as the data contained in an unspecified GoPro camera.\n\nIn another motion filed Tuesday, Dillon said Crimo's father had provided police with video clips from the day of \n\n.\n\n\"In addition,\" Dillon said, \"one of the videos depicts a Honda Fit vehicle pulling into the driveway and an individual who the people have sought to have identified as [Crimo] exiting the vehicle in identical clothing as seen in the Studio One surveillance video prior to and after the shooting.\"\n\nProsecutors have separately filed a motion to call as a witness a former school resource officer assigned to Highland Park High School to identify Crimo from video.\n\nRossetti scheduled a hearing to argue all eight pending motions, some of which the defense attorneys said they will likely not contest. \n\n\"And if Mr. Crimo does not appear in court on Nov. 14,\" the judge said, \"we will proceed with the hearing without him being present.\"\n\n"},

Ohio governor Mike DeWine – a Republican – has bluntly \n\n “a piece of garbage that was simply not true.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, Vance – who helped to spark the controversy with a \n\n a day before the debate – has \n\n that it’s possible that “all of these rumors will turn out to be false.”\n\nA wave of outraged advocates and Haitian residents across the nation have been decrying the pair’s comments as “racist” – including in Essex County, which is home to one of the highest percentages of Haitian immigrants and Haitian-Americans in New Jersey.\n\nLast week, New Jersey Sen. Britnee Timberlake (NJ-34) and Assemblywoman Shanique Speight (NJ-29) introduced a package of proposed laws that are intended to help ease an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Haiti \n\nIn June, the Biden Administration \n\n of temporary protected status for more than 300,000 unauthorized migrants from Haiti living in the United States. While not a permanent legal status, TPS protects against deportation and allows migrants to get a work permit, among other benefits.\n\nAccording to a \n\n in the Federal Register, officials say Haiti continues to experience several serious crises, including deadly gang violence, a lack of economic opportunity and shortages of health care, food and water.\n\n“These circumstances continue to make return to Haiti dangerous for Haitian nationals living in the United States,” the notice states.\n\nTimberlake and Speight expanded on the nation’s recent struggles in a joint statement:\n\nAccording to Timberlake and Speight, here’s what their package of bills would do if they cross the finish line:\n\n The Haitian Migrant Assistance Program requires the Department of Human Services to provide essential social services and financial aid to undocumented Haitian migrants who have been residing in New Jersey for at least two years. These services include access to housing assistance, employment-related case management, legal referrals, and language support, among others.\n\n In addition to the assistance program, S3199 establishes the New Jersey-Haiti Commission. This commission will advise the governor and Legislature on strengthening cultural and economic ties between New Jersey and Haiti, while also addressing the specific needs of the Haitian American community in the state.\n\n Assembly bill A1993 directs the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services to manage the collection of data on Haitian migrants in New Jersey, no matter their documentation status, from various sources such as federal, State, and local governments, and non-profit organizations.\n\n Assembly resolution AR65 urges Congress to provide aid to the migrants of Haiti. This resolution urges Congress to provide support to front-line organizations that work to aid Haitian migrants who were dislocated, detained, and expelled as they sought asylum and safety at the U.S. border.\n\nThe lawmakers said they are working in collaboration with East Orange City Councilman Bergson Leneus, the first Haitian American councilman in the city, and Haitian American organizations around the state such as the National Haitian American Elected Officials Network (NHAEON), New Jersey for Haiti and the Haitian Pastors Association.\n\nTimberlake and Speight said the bills are coming at a critical time, calling Trump’s remarks during the debate “hate-filled” and “xenophobic.”\n\nTimberlake said the issue is deeply personal: her husband and other family members are Haitian American.\n\n“Trump’s hate speech in general, but also about Haitians, is not just offensive—it’s dangerous,” the senator said. “His words unfortunately have the power to incite violence and put people’s lives at risk. We have already seen the harmful effects of anti-immigrant sentiments across the nation, and now – more than ever – we must take action to protect all communities and combat the bigotry that threatens everyone’s safety by affirming our shared humanity.”\n\nSpeight said that people of Haitian descent have revitalized local economies and enriched their communities, including in her home district.\n\n“To see Haitian Americans vilified in such a hateful and xenophobic manner is not just wrong; it's a betrayal of the values this country was founded upon and should uphold,” the assemblywoman said.\n\n"},

A group of school students think so. \n\nDuring the last Council meeting, a group of students from East Brunswick High School petitioned council to lower the voting age in BOE elections. \n\nStudent Roshini Ramesh said the group met with lawmakers, advocates and garnered local support for their cause over the past nine months. \n\nThe group argued that allowing 16- 17-year-olds to vote in local BOE elections would cultivate a lifelong habit of civic engagement. \n\n“While 16-and 17-year-olds are attending high school, there are opportunities for increased civic education as well as information that provides healthy voting habits and lets students know the importance of voting,” high schooler Sahil Kochhar said. \n\nKochhar noted that the high school regularly hosts voter registration drives encouraging hundreds of students to vote. \n\nAnother student told the Council that getting students to vote in BOE elections would allow them to “grow in civic virtue.” The students are part of the group Vote16 EB, a local chapter of Vote16 NJ and \n\n.

Its a great way to maintain the greatness of EB,” Chan said. \n\nThe effort to lower voting age for school board elections is not new. \n\n to allow 16-year-olds to vote in local school board elections by adopting an ordinance in January. \n\nNewark joins the cities of Oakland and Berkley in California in lowering the voting age to 16 for school board elections. Battleboro, Vermont and the municipalities of Greenbelt, Hyattsville, Riverdale Park and Takoma Park in Maryland have lowered the voting age to 16 for all local elections. \n\nIn May New Jersey lawmakers proposed a bill that would lower the voting age for BOE races. \n\nLawmakers introduced \n\n in the Senate that would allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in elections for their local school board. The bill wouldn’t allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in any other election. \n\nThe Senate bill is co-sponsored by Senators Raj Mukherji and Brian Stack. The Assembly bill is co-sponsored by Assemblywomen Cleopatra Tucker and Jessica Ramirez. \n\nThe proposed law has picked up support from civil rights advocates, who say that it’s a win-win proposition for “democracy.” According to Newark-based nonprofit New Jersey Institute for Social Justice (NJISJ), the proposed law could impact almost 240,000 young people across the state. \n\n(Residents who would like to learn more about the effort in East Brunswick, can contact Kochhar at \n\n)\n\n"},

He also had heard the arguments by county leaders that if they voiced strong opposition to the legislation, it could prevent the county from achieving its legislative goals, and result in more state restrictions on the county’s legislative authorities.\n\n“I sincerely doubt that either would happen, particularly if we stand united regionally,” Wolf wrote. “I expect that down-state legislators would know of the power of our local delegation and would not want to set precedents that could come back to bite them.”\n\nPatch reached out to Fairfax County Board Chair Jeff McKay (D-At Large) and Marsden requesting their comments on Wolf's letter.

Facing opposition, Marsden quickly withdrew his bill. A similar bill introduced in the House of Delegates by Del. Wren Williams (R-Stuart) was also withdrawn.\n\nIn January 2024, Marsden re-introduced his casino referendum bill, which included language that clearly identified Tysons as the location of the proposed casino.

Nicole La Ha of Homer Glen in District 82, which includes parts of Burr Ridge, Darien, Lemont and Orland Park, among other towns. \n\nLast week, Akhras told Patch in an interview that she received multiple reports while knocking on doors about a survey telling residents \n\n. \n\nAkhras, who is Muslim, said one of the questions asks, \"Would you vote for Suzanne Akhras if you knew she belonged to Islamic terrorist groups?\"\n\nIn a later statement, the House Republican Organization said its team had no involvement in the poll that Akhras described. At the same time, the group did not condemn such a survey. \n\nThe group said reporters and residents have asked about Akhras' \"extremist ties.\" It said that \"in the spirit of transparency,\" it was providing a \"fact sheet.\"\n\nThe organization noted Akhras' role as \n\n of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR.\n\nIt pointed out a statement by the council's executive director, Nihad Awad, after Hamas' terrorist attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. \n\n\"Yes, I was happy to see the people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land and walk free into their own land that they were not allowed to walk in,\" Awad said in a speech\n\nThe House Republican Organization said it knew of no public statement by Akhras denouncing these comments.\n\nThe group cited \n\n in which Joe Biden's White House disavowed CAIR over Awad's statement. \n\nIn the Times story, Awad said that in the same speech, he denounced hate against Jews and called antisemitism \"a real evil\" that \"has to be rejected and combated by all people.\" He said that part of his comments were not included in the video that circulated online. \n\nThe House Republican Organization also cited the Holy Land Foundation terrorism financing case from 2008, in which CAIR was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator. Holy Land was found to have supported Hamas financially. \n\nIn \n\n, the Washington Post said nearly 250 other organizations and individuals were also named as unindicted co-conspirators. Federal courts later determined it had been a mistake to release the information to the public, the newspaper said. \n\nCAIR wanted its name removed from the list, but a federal judge denied the request. He said the federal government produced enough evidence to show CAIR had links to Holy Land, the Post reported. \n\nIn its \"fact sheet,\" the House Republican Organization said Akhras failed to speak out against the violence. \n\n\"Despite the widespread condemnation of Hamas’s violent actions on October 7th, Akhras has remained silent, not publicly denouncing Hamas or their attacks on Israel,\" the group said.\n\nAkhras' campaign did not return a message for comment in response to the Republicans' criticism.\n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/crystallake/no-halloween-drive-thru-year-mack-manor-changes-operation-plan", "article": "FOX RIVER GROVE, IL — The Mack Manor Christmas and Halloween shows have been 40 years in the making, Laura Mack told Patch this past week. And this year, for the first time in years, the owners of the free drive-thru experience at their home in Fox River Grove had to make a tough decision. \n\nLaura Mack, who, along with her husband, David, and son, Jonas, are the masterminds behind Mack Manor at 1100 Algonquin Road, say there will be no Halloween drive-thru this year as they plan to only have one holiday show per year — this year it will be their Christmas show — instead of two. \n\nNext year: the Halloween show will be back, but there will be no Christmas show. \n\nThere was on specific reason prompting their decision but it was something they \"wrestled with for a couple years,\" Mack said. Typically, the Halloween show would open the first weekend of October.\n\n\"When everything was up and running, the sense of satisfaction would run through your mind and it all seemed worth it. But we realized that these commitments to the displays was getting to consume too much of our lives,\" she said. \"The obligation was from August to January, every waking moment we were either planning or working on the displays.\"\n\n\"We have a growing family, including grandkids, and we would like to spend more time with them and visit other family members,\" she added. \n\nThe Mack family, along with their helpers, who they refer to as their \"Krew,\" have created both the Halloween and Christmas displays since 2009. \n\n\"The amount of work it took to take Halloween down and set up Christmas was almost impossible, both physically and mentally draining,\" she said. \"Losing sleep at night, missing out on many events and functions. It started moving from being 'fun' work to being more 'work' work. And just being tired for months at a time was miserable.\"\n\n\"We are not getting younger,\" she added. \"We felt the best compromise would be to cut back instead of just stopping.\"\n\nMany living in the far Northwest suburbs have heard of Mack Manor or have visited it. Some make it an annual pilgrimage and lines back up along Algonquin Road for those waiting to tune their radio to the select station to enjoy the Halloween, or Christmas music, as they roll through.\n\nDuring Halloween, there are actors who meander the grounds, and plenty of special effects. Over the past 10 years — during non-COVID years — around 15,000 people visit during each holiday, Mack said. \n\nIn 2020 and 2021, that number doubled. Not only did the COVID-19 pandemic draw residents to the drive-thru and more socially distanced entertainment over the holidays, but the Christmas lights show was also coming off some fame in the national spotlight. \n\nIn 2018, Mack Manor was featured on ABC's \"The Great Christmas Light Fight.\"\n\n\"We actually turned them down twice since they wanted us to skip Halloween one year in order to film a Christmas episode. Instead a compromise was made to tape the show one year early, after Halloween,\" Mack said. \n\nDuring those years, wait times to roll through the holiday shows were long and the Mack family opted to open up the shows for longer hours. \n\n\"We had cars lined up for one to two hours waiting to drive thru. There was a lot of collaboration with police departments to keep some semblance of order,\" they said. \"The patience of our neighbors was tested to the limits during that year.\"\n\nThe Halloween Mack Manor began in 1986 in Palatine as cardboard boxes and flashlights in the Mack's front year. This progressed to a haunted house in the backyard for one day, built with 2-by-4's and black plastic. \n\n\"Neighborhood kids would work in the house and scare people. For Christmas, many people would park and walk by gazing at the Christmas display,\" she said. \n\nIn 1996, the Mack family moved to their Fox River Grove home on Algonquin Road and started decorating for Christmas. \n\n\"We would face blowups and lights towards the street. People would drive by slowly and enjoy what they could see,\" Mack said. \n\nBy 1999, the Macks had been in touch with the Fox River Grove Recreation Council and ran fund raising efforts to help make a haunted house possible. That haunted house was located in Lion's Park for 10 years. \n\n\"Many of the neighborhood kids from the Palatine Halloween display work with us. They were aptly dubbed 'Skelton Krew,'\" said Mack, who added a core group of the volunteers still are the main players behind Mack Manor today. \"Our children’s friends, along with volunteers, would work in the Lion’s Park haunted house. When our children graduated high school, and we ran out of volunteers, this event closed in 2008.\"\n\nIn 2000, as traffic continued to back up along Algonquin Road from passersby checking out the Christmas display, the Macks opened up their driveway for people to drive through.\n\n\"In the next several years, traffic increased and the lines on the street started forming. This meant we would have to be outside controlling traffic on weekends,\" they said. \n\nIn 2009, the Macks and the \"Krew\" opened the Mack Manor Halloween drive-thru at the Macks' Fox River Grove home. \n\n\"The Krew would be outside scaring cars on weekends, but this led to the beginning of many traffic issues. We had only one entrance and exit, so we would have to direct traffic and allow only one car in as one car exited for all holidays and only seven cars would fit at a time,\" she added.\n\nThe Mack family opted for a driveway expansion prior to filming the \"The Great Christmas Light Fight\" in 2018.\n\n\"This choice to be on TV contributed to the decision to expand our driveway 500 feet in the front yard and double the entrance to allow cars to enter and exit at the same time before taping of the show,\" she said. \n\nPatch has included the full questions and answer with Laura Mack below, which explains their decision to change up their holiday shows. \n\nWe have already felt the positives. We will be able to take our time and enjoy the decorating process. We have started Christmas planning/testing. We have been able to spend a lot of time with two new granddaughters, visiting family. Actually we plan on going on a vacation to see the Disney not-so-spooky display. These are things we never would have been able to do. This is the first time in years, we can attend Christmas events as well.\n\nWe are planning on setting-up every available blowup/light that we have. Most years we have 10 to 20 percent of items that never make it into the display. The thought always was — just get it up. This year the thought is to make it look more amazing than ever.\n\nWe plan on being open early in December in order to accommodate more visitors. We encourage visitors to come in early December and not wait until the week before Christmas as the lines get much longer. \n\nWait and see what we have planned, the biggest and most Mackified yet!\n\nWe are already starting the Christmas setup with testing lights being our first step. We will be pulling out all the blowups soon and replacing bulbs. We will be able to spend time with our granddaughters, including trick or treating. We would like to visit other displays in the area as well as visit some haunted houses — this is something we love to do just haven’t had the time for it.\n\n The commitment starts in August and goes until January. When we were open during October/December, we spent every night running the display. We could not be open unless we were home. This meant that all our personal time went into the Halloween/Christmas Drive The for the months of October/December. We wouldn’t even be able to go out for dinner with many dinners being spent in the \"tent' working the flame pots or making sure snow/ice/wind did not affect the Christmas display. \n\nChecking weather constantly and making sure decorations were down/protected was also timely. There were many sleepless nights when the wind would pick up, just thinking that everything will be shredded or torn down once we checked in the morning. You get used to listening for changes in weather and then worried about going outside and seeing damage that occurred. It would take a couple of months to get out of \"check the weather mode.\"\n\nOn Nov. 1st, we started taking Halloween down and did not stop, for even a minute, until we opened the Christmas display. This was very exhausting and eventually started consuming the fun of the entire process. We were unable to spend time doing anything else during the month of November except working on the display, constantly worrying about getting Christmas up and running without getting too far in December.\n\nJust getting in and out of our home was a process. We (or visitors to our home) would actually have to enter the line and drive through the display to leave. Sometimes ourselves, or family/visitors, had to wait in lines to even get into our driveway — Christmas Eve was always crazy. We’ve been honked at because people were thinking we were “cutting the line” when all we wanted to do was get home. We had a house full of family and even Santa had trouble visiting us.\n\nWe’ve missed many events due to the commitment, and sometimes burden, of getting the displays up and running as soon as possible so we can open as early in the season as possible. Now that we’re only doing Christmas this year we will be able to see out of town family for Thanksgiving this year, go trick or treating with Grand daughters, and even \"going to Disney\n\nWorld.\"\n\nWe will miss the process of planning the layout (Halloween layout this year), coming up with tombstones, brainstorming new attractions, seeing skeletons and spending time with the Krew.\n\nWe will miss the sheer entertainment our visitors brought us. The support from everyone has been wonderful regarding this decision. Many cannot believe we did both holidays for this long and are excited to see what we have planned with the new scheudle.\n\nJust the thought of how quiet it will be on October evenings is a downer, but then we think about plans for next Halloween!\n\n"},

He was survived by his cousin, Sally Isaac, of Greenfield, Lancashire, United Kingdom, and her two children, Matthew Parker, of Edenbridge, Kent, UK, and Louise Parker-Backhouse, of Failswort, Manchester, UK, as well as many friends, from all around the world, who he knew in person and online. \n\nJohn was born in England as an only child. His father was employed by Royal Dutch Shell as a petroleum engineer, prospecting for oil in South America when he was drafted into the Royal Air Force as part of the engineering corps and special forces regiment. \n\nDuring World War II, Walter was instrumental in cutting off Burmese oil supplies to Japan, creating a bomb used to destroy oil wells and refineries he had previously helped build. A July 1942 TIME Magazine article described Burma as wholly scorched. With Walter performing such a smashing job, experts believed many of the 600 wells would never be able to produce oil again. The article described Walter as “the greatest saboteur in history,” keeping “just ahead of the enemy,” destroying an estimated 20 million pounds of machinery.\n\nWalter reached the rank of second lieutenant and was bestowed with the Order of the British Empire by King George and a Legion of Merit Officer award from President Franklin Roosevelt in April 1944.\n\nForster’s grandfather, on his mother’s side, also worked at Royal Dutch. His mother was described as a formidable woman who devoted time to raising money for the war effort and visiting wounded soldiers before John came into the world.\n\nAfter John was born, the family moved to Montreal, Canada. \n\nJohn came to America to attend college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering in 1967. He went on to earn other degrees, including electrical and mechanical engineering. \n\nWhile at MIT, John was actively involved in dynamic astronomy, understanding forces in motion, orbits, and the rotation of products and technology. He also worked on water turbines to generate power, run motors, and instrumentation work. John performed lab work at MIT for the government, including inertial navigation for the Apollo program, and Draper was the prime contractor. \n\nOne project John worked on was a sextant for the Apollo. \n\nSextants were used on ships and boats to measure the angles between the stars and the horizon to set navigation. The sextant was built into the walls of the spacecraft and was used to determine its navigation. This would allow astronauts to set and correct the course of the rockets by measuring the ship’s orbit and placement with the Moon, Earth, the Sun, and stars. His work in electro-optics also discovered several unconventional uses for ultraviolent light, infrared, and wavelengths not visible to the human eye.\n\nAfter Apollo, John went out on his own with several friends and associates at Draper, founding Scientific Imaging Systems Inc., expanding electro-optics — taking very faint light sources in space beyond what was seen from an ordinary telescope and transforming the data digitally. \n\nThe work often had military applications, and the company was doing things that would lead to the commercialization of digital photography. One camera collected particles and photons with each pixel, sensing the circuit in the camera based on the light source and collecting many photons. This was decades ahead of the state-of-the-art digital cameras of today. \n\nThe company, however, dissolved later without bringing any products to market.\n\nJohn moved to Belmont in August 1976, living first on Concord Avenue and, later, Crestview Drive on Belmont Hill, near Chuck Counselman, one of his professors at MIT, in June 1987. \n\nCounselman invented the macro-meter interferometric surveyor, the technology that later became commonly known as global positioning systems, and other patents. He sold the GPS patent early in the game to Litton Industries-Northrup Grumman but worked for them as a contractor. Counselman and an attorney hunted down various companies that stole his patents, winning nearly every lawsuit. At one point, John went to work with Counselman as a contractor, assisting in proving the other companies were stealing the technology. One task they needed to do was to get around the epoxy plastic to see inside the counterfeit devices without destroying the transistors to gather the proof. John had a telescope-like device Counselman had never seen before that accessed the inside of the units and identified the silicon chip and part numbers without damaging the devices.\n\nAfter being hired and doing the work, John refused to bill for his services, turning down fees in the high five figures (or six figures today). The reason? He did not want to give the company any of his personal identifying information. \n\nJohn never had a credit card and tried to stay under the radar and off the grid. This required relying on friends to access things he needed but could not get without credit or debit cards. Those same friends would be involved in conversations and communications for years, even decades, via email threads and chat boards with John, creating long friendships.\n\nJohn was described as principled, private, and an occasional political prankster. While living in town, he was involved in a few kerfuffles and lawsuits, including one case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nIn May 1996, the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints applied to build a temple on Belmont Hill with the Angel Moroni on top of the building. \n\nBut the height of the spire would be taller than the allowed zoning. The spire was reduced slightly. \n\nBlasting caused several issues in the neighborhood, including strewn debris, and a work permit was revoked until the problems could be resolved. After a hearing and approval by the zoning board of appeals, abutters, and others sued to overturn the approval, calling the state’s Dover Amendment a violation of the separation of church and state. A U.S. District Court judge in May 1999 ruled the Dover Amendment constitutional, but a superior court revoked the approval. The church appealed, and a federal circuit court agreed with them. John and others petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, and in January 2001, after being constructed, the court refused to hear the case. Five months later, the state supreme judicial court overturned the county court decision, and the Angel Moroni was placed atop the temple in September 2001.\n\nThe temple was the Mormon’s 100th.\n\nMany Belmontians accused John of fighting the temple because he was discriminatory. While he was not religious or spiritual in any way, he maintained publicly and privately the case was about an exception for religious organizations that ordinary people could never receive.\n\nAnother lawsuit involved the height of lights on the Belmont High School football field on Concord Avenue. \n\nJohn and others filed a case in Middlesex County Superior Court after the town’s zoning board of appeals allowed the school committee to install lights more than 20 feet high. John, who owned property across the street, said he opposed the lights because they would bother him when shone into his home. The filers also challenged information at the proceedings, saying they were not appropriately consulted, among other issues.\n\nMany in town saw the lawsuit as an attack against students and football, a common theme in Belmont — anyone who challenges anything connected to the school system was not seen as just a critic but, instead, a child hater. While some committee members admitted neighbors would be upset and that was how things were, John said the project was railroaded through.\n\nIn the end, the lights were installed. But it did not matter because John no longer lived at the address. Unbeknownst to many residents then, it had essentially become his storage space. Regardless, the principle was no other entity in the community would be allowed to get a waiver on the light height like that.\n\nAnother issue was a change to the town’s noise bylaw that allowed much higher sound levels at earlier times of the day. \n\nLandscape and construction companies wanted to start their work earlier in the day. There was a balance between wanting to be “The Town of Homes” and being able to get projects completed and jobs done. \n\nAt a public hearing in January 2002, John set up a pair of speakers in the room to replicate the level of sound produced so committee members would hear audio evidence of the level of sound the new bylaw would allow. \n\nA board member, Guy Carbone, a Democrat turned Republican who unsuccessfully ran for attorney general, Congress, and state Senate, said John should be banned from testifying because he would not reveal his residency for the record. John countered Carbone was trying to violate the state’s open meeting law and was allowed to proceed. \n\nFirst, John played a videotape of a rock drill at 65 decibels, the allowable noise level at the time. It was so loud committee members began to cover their ears, and John had to shout to speak over the noise. Carbone made a stink about the presentation, but others booed him down in attendance. John then increased the volume to 90 decibels while Counselman, who was on the committee, held a noise meter showing other members the new allowable level. John then played a hoe ramp and an audio tone generator — creating a high-pitched buzzing sound at both levels. \n\nAt that point, Gladys Unger, the committee chairwoman, had enough and requested John turn off the noise. \n\n“Thank you, madam chairman,” he said, shutting off the speakers. “You have made my exact point.” \n\nIn the end, the committee approved the change and Town Meeting did, too, with only a smattering of voice votes saying No.\n\nAnother incident that ripped the town apart was Romney’s return to town in March 2002 after spending three years successfully turning around the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the wake a bribery and ethics scandal probe of the Olympics committee. \n\nTown officials, including the then-chairman of the Board of Selectmen, William Monahan, another former Democrat turned Republican who was in a brutal reelection campaign, held a rally in the center of town. What was not known at the time was behind the scenes, forces were working to push the acting governor, Jane Swift, out of office. Romney had made statements months before he would not challenge a sitting Republican governor. \n\nOn the day of the rally, wet, heavy snow fell on Belmont as hundreds of people welcomed the Romneys home.\n\nBut the “welcome home” event quickly turned into what appeared to be a political event. \n\nDuring the presentation, Monahan presented Romney with a box of sneakers and stated, “Run, Mitt, Run.” Others in the crowd had pulled out their Romney for Senate campaign signs when he lost to U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy in 1994 and covered the word “Senate” with “Governor.” At least one “Run Mitt, Run” sign was hung on a town government building. \n\nThe next day, after a devastating poll showed Romney trouncing Swift by more than 60 points, she said she would not run. A few hours later, Romney announced his run for governor.\n\nMany, including John, were incensed. \n\nQuestions began to fly around about how much town taxpayers paid for the dozens of cops working parking and traffic details, other town and school employees working that day, and the sound system rented by the town. Several politically left-of-center parents of Belmont High School band students who performed at the event were upset their children were at what appeared to be a partisan event.\n\nThe total bill for expenses, estimated by the Belmont Citizen-Herald, which turned out to be off, was in the $3,000 range, or around $5,500 in 2024 dollars.\n\nThe controversy dragged on for weeks, with John and others fanning the flames.\n\nThe town’s next Board of Selectmen erupted in back-and-forth accusations about the event right before the town election. John, Counselman, and others criticized the leaders for turning the event into a political rally, refusing to answer or confirm costs estimated by the newspaper, and hiding from possible state conflict of interest violations. The leaders defended themselves, saying it was not planned to be a political event. \n\nFearing there might be volatility at the meeting, a few Belmont police officers, including Monahan’s son, were in attendance. Monahan called the event a nice gesture for the Romneys and said no one officially organized it. During the discussion, he also downplayed the costs. But John countered the money would have been better spent filling potholes in the town’s notoriously bad streets and roads. \n\nOne Town Meeting member in attendance, Dante Muzzioli, a long-time Belmont High School hockey coach involved in the football light installation project, called the critics “a poison pill to this community.” Monahan had to call the meeting to order several times because attendees, including Muzzi and John, were yelling at each other. \n\nJohn said to Monahan during the meeting, “I have come up here repeatedly because the bylaws in this town are selectively enforced to the benefit of the friends of the selectmen, time and time again.” Monahan spat back, “You can say whatever you want, but don’t try to impugn my integrity.” \n\nA week later, Monahan lost reelection to Dr. Paul Solomon.\n\nA week after that, Romney became the Republican nominee for governor. \n\nThe Citizen-Herald published articles showing the Romney campaign gave consultant Mike Murphy $11,300 ($20K today) to have the event recorded. Weeks before the rally, the Romney campaign spent $18,000 ($32K today) on polling. One outstanding expense was the lighting and sound company that staged the event, which was owed $7,300. Taggert Romney, acting as a liaison between his father, the campaign, volunteers, Murphy, and others, was reimbursed for tens of thousands of dollars in expenses, including hotel rooms and other items. \n\nAccording to records, Romney was not a very good voter — missing eight elections between 1996 and 2002.\n\nIn February 2008, when Romney’s first bid for the presidency was fizzling out, John privately submitted a photo to the Citizen-Herald of a trashcan with a “Romney for President” sign with dollar bills inside taken outside of the governor’s Marsh Road home at the time with the words, “A Sign Of The Times?” It was published on the Comment page. \n\nJohn was also involved in a long-time fight with the town over meter reading and billing by the water department at his two Belmont homes (including one that, again, was essentially a storage space and had limited-to-no water usage).\n\nThe town issued bills for water and sewer based on estimated usage because he would not allow them onto his property to be measured. When he refused to pay the bills, they were doubled and redoubled, and soon, the town tax collector went after him. \n\nAt one point, the bills reached more than $57,000 — a ridiculous amount of money for a water bill on two homes, even if a family lived in Belmont for decades, never mind a single person. John paid some of the bills but later stopped. He claimed he stopped paying due to overbilling, “inflated” and “fraudulent” costs, and “bogus readings.” John claimed the town owed him more than $20,000. A water meter was eventually replaced on the Concord Avenue address.\n\nIn one of its decisions on the matter, the court said John was responsible for paying the bill and then seeking relief from the courts.\n\nA few years later, the town sued John for violating town bylaws by having unregistered vehicles at his home on Crestview Drive. This ridiculous requirement violated a town bylaw.\n\nIn September 2009, another controversy arose — whether Kennedy had influence over the \n\n.\n\nAt Kennedy’s funeral, the late Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, stated he called Kennedy to ask for assistance in the case, and, at another meeting, Kennedy told him, “All of Western Massachusetts will see the Angel” on top of the temple. On a Utah Policy blog post two days before the funeral, Jared Whitley, a former Hatch staffer, also claimed the senators met in 2006 to discuss health care policy, and during the conversation, Kennedy quipped he was responsible for installing the spire. \n\nJohn and others were surprised by the comments, but they also confirmed their suspicions the fix was in on the temple lawsuits. They were surprised the justices seemed disinterested in the facts of the case and sympathetic toward the church’s arguments. John was particularly disappointed since advocates argued one way at the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court level and another at the U.S. Supreme Court, he said at the time.\n\n“The neighbors went to the courts expecting a fair hearing and a decision based on the law and the Constitution,” he wrote in an email. “It is distressing to learn that powerful senators moved behind the scenes to deny (us) due process.”\n\nA spokeswoman for the MA SJC denied the claims, saying no calls were made to the courts about the case. Kennedy’s office refused requests for comment.\n\nThroughout his life, John was obsessive about tinkering and fixing things, often injecting new life into stuff that no longer worked. \n\nIn his idle years, he bought stuff manically, all treasures to him, but he was also frugal. Later, he volunteered for Battleship Cove, the U.S. Navy memorial museum, restoring electronics on the battleship Massachusetts. John also worked to restore old war and military radios and conversed with others involved in radio technology online.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with diabetes and attempting to recover from medical procedures, John moved into a hotel in Burlington near the Leahy Clinic to be as close to doctors as possible. He did not know at the time he would spend many years living there. Friends would visit him and assist him with projects and tending to his properties. He was grateful for their time and generous, too, with his. Many hotel staff got to know him well, and he often praised them for taking such good care of him.\n\nJohn dispersed money to his family, friends, business associates, and organizations in his estate. He also bequeathed funds to the hotel staff, housekeepers, and cooks. His estate will establish a fund for any staffers he may have not named. \n\nMemorials were held for John on May 11 at the MIT Chapel with family and friends and on Aug. 10 at a luncheon in Waltham with caretakers, friends, and neighbors. Many of his friends noted how odd it was their friendships with John had all been kept separate after years.\n\nEven in death, John worked toward preserving his privacy and principles: As part of his estate, he established a sub-trust of $250,000 for an attorney to pursue a lawsuit against the town of Belmont “for slander of title related to water and sewer liens on my Belmont property.” \n\nHere’s hoping the town agrees to settle the matter once and for all.\n\n"},

Or, more accurately, tickled orange, yellow and white. \n\nIn recent weeks, Great Wolf Lodge debuted its first-ever \n\n at the popular resort and water park at 1700 Nations Drive, Gurnee. A suite is also available to book at the Great Wolf Lodge Pocono Mountains, in Pennsylvania, this Halloween season. \n\nBRACH's officials told Patch that their surveys have found that 64 percent of Americans planning to celebrate fall enjoy eating candy corn. And while only 25 percent of the four people in our group staying in the suite in recent weeks also enjoyed the sweet treat, it was hard not to be impressed by our surroundings. \n\nFrom candy corn headboards to an illuminated wall to a candy corn checkers game, BRACH'S design team \"went through a number of creative iterations\" before perfecting the room, said Chad Womack, director of seasonal marketing at Ferrara Candy Company. \n\n\"Our priority was to ensure the candy corn décor elements showed up in a fun, unique way that only BRACH’S could do,\" Womack said. \n\nThe collaboration is a new venture for Great Wolf and BRACH's, and the first time Great Wolf has ever partnered with a major brand, like BRACH's, said Jason Lasecki, Great Wolf Lodge VP of Corporate Communications. \n\n\"This is BRACH’S first collaboration with Great Wolf Lodge, and we’re so excited to bring the Candy Corn Suite to candy corn superfans and their families,\" Womack said. \"This is a first-of-its-kind partnership for BRACH’S, and we were strategic on when to launch the suite. We knew we wanted to tie it to the Halloween season, knowing that’s when candy corn really has its big moment.\"\n\nChicago-based Ferrara Candy Company opted to bring their suites to nearby Gurnee, with hopes of drawing candy corn fans from Chicago and Milwaukee to Great Wolf this fall, Womack said. Meanwhile, residents out east opt to get away to the Pocono Mountains for \"its beautiful scenery\" in the fall, making it a good spot for the second Great Wolf candy corn suite destination. \n\nBRACH's market research shows that 96 percent of candy corn superfans in the U.S. \"enjoy participating in fall and Halloween activities\" compared to 84 percent of all residents across the U.S. \n\nAnd even if you are not a candy corn fan, the fully stocked pantry cart in the suite will provide you with more than enough candy to hand out this Halloween. And the cart also includes BRACH's new \"Mellowcreme\" Autumn Leaves candy, which 100 percent of our group enjoyed. \n\nVisitors to the suite also receive a membership to BRACH's Candy Corn Club so they can enjoy the seasonal treat year-round, Womack said. There’s also a V.I.P. parking spot included, which allows for parking near the Great Wolf entrance. \n\nThemed hotel rooms have been popping up across Illinois and the U.S. Earlier this year, USA Today \n\n across the country, which included Big Idaho Potato Hotel in South Boise, Idaho; and Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida. \n\n\"Themed hotel rooms are a kitschy throwback to the '70s and '80s, a time when people were looking for an escape within driving distance,\" \n\n writes in the USA Today column. \n\nEarlier this year, Motel 6 teamed up with Sony Pictures Entertainment this ahead of \"The Garfield Move\" premiere to appoint Garfield as the \"first-ever Chief Pet Officer of Motel 6.\" They also created Garfield-themed rooms at one of 10 family and pet-friendly Motel 6 locations, which were available through July. \n\n\"In this campaign, Garfield extended his reach beyond the big screen to help provide more insight on how to make traveling with pets easier and more importantly, fun,\" said Motel 6 spokeswoman Haley Klein. \n\nThe rooms included orange fur and cat stripe-printed walls to animated plush pillows. Those staying could also enter for the chance to win four tickets to join Garfield on the orange carpet at the movie premiere in May, along with travel and a two-night stay in the Motel 6 Hollywood Garfield Immersive Suite.\n\nFor Great Wolf, themed rooms are also not new. In 2023, the resort offered its pumpkin spice-themed suites, which allowed guests to immerse themselves in the popular fall treat. \n\n\"\n\n is the delightful pumpkin spice aromatherapy. The room is infused with the comforting scent of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, creating an atmosphere that is both soothing and invigorating. It’s like being wrapped in a warm, fragrant hug of pumpkin goodness,\" according to Great Wolf's news release from last year. \n\nLike this year's candy corn suite, the pumpkin-spiced suite also offered \n\nRegardless, Lasecki says this year's partnership with BRACH's has been \"exceptional.\" \n\n\"Great Wolf Lodge is a resort destination that is focused on bringing joy to families, and our friends at BRACH'S are all about moments of connection and celebration, so it’s been a lot of fun working together to create the BRACH’S Candy Corn Suite,\" said Lasecki, adding that Great Wolf officials \"are absolutely thrilled with the result and feel fans of both brands will absolutely love it.\" \n\nHe foresees similar partnerships in the coming years. \n\n\"Yes, we're all for creative partnerships that offer a unique experience for our guests and are actively exploring opportunities for 2025 and beyond.

These skills have appropriately prepared me for the role of Coroner of McHenry County. \n\nThrough publically politicizing death related statistics.

We truly miss him every day,” said Chief James Sabath noting that Gregg’s presence continues to be felt every day at the station and through the insignias that have been placed in his memory on the borough’s patrol cars.\n\n“A lot of us didn’t have the fortune of getting to know Officer Gregg but we’ve heard a lot of stories after the fact. We are sorry that we didn’t get to know him,” said the chief.\n\nFormer Newtown Borough Police Officer Colleen Rosenfeld, who often partnered with Gregg while on duty, said Gregg enjoyed being out in the community and interacting with the public.\n\n\"Brian and I started working together because we got along,” she said. “He absolutely loved business checks and community events - anything that gave him the chance to mix and mingle,” she said. “One of my favorite memories of him is his love of creamy peanut butter bars from \n\nNewtown Chocolatier.“\n\nChief Sabath said that Gregg left a legacy for the department to follow of community policing, setting the example of walking downtown, talking with and interacting with people. “That legacy lives on in the department. I’m sure he would be pleased with the direction the department has made in the different things we have done and the different things we have accomplished.”\n\nOfficer Gregg had just started as a full-time officer after serving as a part-time officer when tragedy struck. He was shot and killed on Sept. 29, 2005 after a prisoner was able to gain possession of his partner's service weapon in the emergency department at St. Mary.\n\nThe 46-year-old officer and his partner were guarding a suspect who had been arrested earlier in\n\n the evening for drunk driving and had been taken to the hospital to undergo blood and urine tests. \n\nWhile in the emergency room, the man began to struggle with the officers. He gained control of the second officer's service weapon and opened fire, striking Officer Gregg in the chest. The man also shot the second officer in the chest and wounded a hospital technician. The prisoner then walked up to Officer Gregg who was on the ground, and shot him in the head, killing him.\n\nThe man fled the emergency room and was located about an hour later hiding in a car in the hospital's parking garage. He was taken into custody and charged with one count of capital murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to death on Nov. 17, 2006.\n\nGregg was born in Bristol and grew up in Levittown. He was a graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School (Harry S Truman High School), the Bucks County Community College, Ferris State University and the Middlesex Fire Academy.\n\nFor 15 years, Gregg worked as a contractor and owned his own business in the area. He then pursued his ambition to become a police officer graduating from the Temple University Police Academy in 2002.\n\nGregg was hired as a part-time officer with Newtown Borough in 2003. He was later hired as a full time officer in October 2004. \n\n“Brian truly loved his community and he was proud to serve the town of Newtown,” reads his obituary. “He never hesitated to answer the call to duty or to help others.” \n\nIn April 2014 a section of the Newtown Bypass between South State Street and Durham Road was renamed the Officer Gregg Memorial Bypass. The borough also dedicated a park in his memory on North Congress Street.\n\n"},

Establish a human exploitation and trafficking organization to mitigate against growing exploitation of documented and undocumented people in our community.\n\nMy opponent gave probation to a privilege man from Campton Hills who beat his mother to death; that will not happen on my watch; my opponent takes money from exotic dance clubs to fund her campaign - I will not, my opponent has given the elected Sheriff 10,000 for his reelection campaign thus affecting true independence. It is important to work with our law enforcement, but independence is what people deserve. My opponent has over doubled her budget in 3 years while the county is in a budget crisis and our population is decreasing, and the community is not any safer; rather it is less safe. In April of 2024 outside sources have reported that crime is up in Kane County, specifically child exploitation and vehicle theft. \n\nMy opponent has used the office to target political opponents (duly elected Campton Hills Trustee) even her former campaign manager, Jeff Ward (thefirstward.net) pointed out my opponent's \"political witch hunting\". My opponent is involved in investigations regadring the Sheriff's Department and has given the Sheriff 10,000 for his campaign. This will compromise the integrity of the investigations, and the citizens deserve better. There are many questionable plea bargains that my opponent has been involved in, one of which I mentioned above about the beating of a woman in Campton Hills.\n\nRoot out the cause of crime, collaborate with law enforcement, keep politics out of the office, equal justice for ALL PEOPLE, advocate for victims of crime.\n\nI was the founder of the Kane County Child Advocacy Center in the mid1990s. It is that spirit that I will bring to the office. In my 35 years as an attorney, I have worked with numerous organization that deal with crime, mental illness, and bigotry. I will draw these people together and use a community prosecution model to lift up our communities, punish offenders and enhance community safety. \n\nAt 64years old, I want to give back to my community and keep it safe. I am not looking for a job and I am not looking to \"keep my job\". I am willing to take a major pay cut to serve our citizens. I do not like what I am seeing happening in our communities with laws foisted upon by Springfield that do not represent our communities.\n\nIt is always about cost vs benefit. I am hugely in favor of doing a deep dive into many of the programs that my opponent has started. My opponent will say they work because no politician wants to say otherwise. When a budget has more than doubled, people deserve to know whether programing is truly working or feeding the political machine.\n\nI am truly independent and will not be controlled by any party or politician. \n\nThere is not enough real data to determine its effectiveness. However, Illinois is the only state in the United States that has such a law, and I do not like our citizens being test subjects as to whether something works or not when we see crime rising in our neighborhoods. \n\nAs the State's Attorney, I will use all taxpayer resources allotted to my office, to keep EVERYONE SAFE and to prosecute all people who commit crimes. I think the taxpayers should have the right to answer this question. \n\nYes, because when you have unscheduled drop-offs you are exposing people to exploitation. We need to work with law enforcement to make sure anyone dropped off is safe. I will personally work with law enforcement to make sure any people entering our county get to the nearest safety zone which is in Chicago.\n\n"},

The Circuit Clerk's Office has little impact on the national economy but can make a difference for some people locally. For example, the Circuit Clerk's Office hosts expungement clinics to help clean up records to help people gain employment. We build partnerships to increase the success of the clinics held in different locations in the county. Many people have taken advantage of these clinics so they may gain employment.\n\nExperience is a critical difference between my opponent and I. I have served as the Kane County Circuit Clerk for nearly 4 years and served on the Kane County Board for eight years. Previously, I worked in the Kane County Clerk's Office as well as the City of Aurora holding various positions in the City Clerk's Office, Building and Permits and Community Development. With these positions I gained administrative, budget and managerial experience. Altogether, I have over 30 years experience in government.\n\nThe success of the Circuit Clerk's depends on the working relationship with our judicial partners. I have worked hard to establish a good working relationship with the Judges and the States Attorney. We meet regularly and address issues. Innovation is another pillar. I have had great success because of the relationships I established with IT and our computer vendor. As a result we have been successful with several upgrades and the new software has resulted in a more robust system and users including the public, judges and attorneys are able access what they need on demand. I bring a strong work ethic to the position. I lead by example and it has made a difference with staff who are greatly appreciated by the judges and attorneys. \n\nContinuing to keep technology up to date. Expanding on technological capabilities in conjunction with the other judicial partners. \n\nI am seeking another term to continue to build on my previous accomplishments and help make the Kane County Circuit Clerk's office among the best in the State. We are a leader in many areas and I would like to do more. \n\nWhen I was a County Board member we set policy and budgets. As Circuit Clerk that still applies along with following state statutes. My goal is to stay within budget and provide the best customer service with the resources we have.\n\nAs a former Kane County Board Member, I am sensitive to the budget and its impact on taxpayers. The Circuit Clerk's office has come in under budget for the past three years. We have been successful with over $1. million in grants since 2021. This helps the office to do more with less reliance on local tax dollars. \n\nWe received the Tyler Award for Excellence and participated in the Pilot Program with the State of Il for the SAFE-T ACT. Our work was beneficial for other counties when the SAFE-T went into effect.\n\nThe SAFE-T act had a bold vision but had unintended consequences. Changes needed to be made to make the system fair. Many tweaks have been made and will continue to be made. In Kane County we have a working group of which I am a part of that looks at current and proposed legislation.\n\nThis isn't applicable to the duties of the Circuit Clerk or office.\n\nAs Circuit Clerk this is not applicable to the office.\n\n"},

Under the Peabody proposal, those born on or after Jan. 1, 2004 would be subject to the lifetime ban.\n\nThe idea of the ordinance is that, as the population ages, fewer and fewer residents would be able to legally purchase the products until eventually they become obsolete.\n\nBrookline's ban was upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court with several other Massachusetts cities and towns then passing or considering similar ordinances.\n\nBut Manning-Martin and Gamache spoke at Thursday's Board of Health meeting against the measure — arguing that it could harm small businesses, create an unnecessary regulation and restrict rights for some residents based solely on their age.\n\n\"What really concerns me is that taking an action like this seems to create another class of citizens based on the time they were born,\" Manning-Martin said. \"They won't have the same opportunities to make individual decisions about their health even as unhealthy as this decision may be.\"\n\nManning-Martin also questioned the timing of the ban considering that, according to data she provided, smoking rates for adolescents have dropped from 9.8 percent of the age group in 1991 to less than 1 percent in 2021.\n\nShe also expressed concerns that banning the purchase would create a \"black market\" of tobacco sales in the city.\n\nGamache's issues were more business-related in that they had the potential to harm small businesses — including convenience stores and gas station stores — during a difficult economic time while making Peabody an outlier community restricting the sales by age when they might still be allowed in most other cities and towns across the North Shore.\n\n\"I can't understand why we would enter into this and allow for the city to become more or less an island in not selling to those people who were born after 2004,\" he said. \"My understanding is that, yeah, it's something that is necessary but I don't think that this is the time or the place to do it.\n\n\"Small businesses are hurting. This is part of their income and their livelihood. As you and I both know, you go into a store and most of the sales are cigarettes and lottery.\"\n\nGamache added that while the harmful health effects of alcohol use are also well-established, that is not a substance that the city is proposing to ban for those born after a certain date.\n\nHealth Director Sharon Cameron said the language of the ordinance was modeled after the Brookline law that passed SJC review. While she said she did not have information on how other bans have affected small business revenue, she did say that those in Winchester told her they found it beneficial to have one date to determine whether a customer could purchase tobacco products rather than the ever-changing date 21 years prior to the current one.\n\nBoard of Health member Julia Fleet noted that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the sale of tobacco to those born after 2003, but not deny the use of those products within city limits.\n\n\"We're not outlawing it,\" she said. \"This isn't a prohibition of the use of tobacco. It's just a statement that Peabody and the Board of Public Health recognize that smoking continues to be detrimental to health and a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.\"\n\nWhile the Board of Health appeared split on the issue, with member Anthony Carli also expressing concerns about the ordinance, it did vote in favor of holding a public hearing to listen to more public input.\n\nChair Thomas Durkin advised that the hearing be held in a much bigger room given the interest that the proposal has generated in emails and news coverage leading up to Thursday's meeting.\n\n"},

Bring your croissant. We encourage people to sit on the lawn, sit on the benches. It’s going to be a lovely spot.”\n\nAdded former councilor Tara Grunde McLaughlin, “One thing the borough never had was a place to take your sandwich and coffee and just sit. Now we have a park with plantings and flowers and you can come and enjoy, see your neighbors. It’s also a great place for children to run around and play.”\n\nIn preparation for the opening, teams of volunteers descended on the park last weekend for a community planting event that saw hundreds of native plants added to the park’s landscape.\n\n“We had children and adults helping out,” said Woldorf. “Because the soil was compacted and very dry, it was hard work. There will be a lot of sore people tomorrow,\" she said. \"But we got it done. We are grateful to everyone who came out to help. We just need some rain now.\"\n\nDesigned by NAM Planning & Design, LLC, and built by Gasper Landscape Design & Construction, the park with walking paths and period landscape reflects the style of gardens back in Colonial times, which would have included plants native to America as well as those brought over from England. \n\nColonial gardens had clearly defined paths and garden bed edges, said Woldorf. “Paths were simple and direct and often made of gravel or brick. There would be trellises and arbors supporting native vines,” she said.\n\n“The plantings also reflect the history of that property, which was the site of a Revolutionary War skirmish,” said Woldorf.\n\nDuring that skirmish, Loyalists raided the property where tailors were mending and making uniforms for Patriots encamped at Valley Forge. During the 1778 skirmish, five Patriots were killed, four were wounded, 11 were taken prisoner, and 2,000 yards of cloth were destroyed or \n\ntaken.\n\nTo reflect that history, Woldorf said some of the plantings selected for inclusion at the park were used in the early manufacturing of fabrics. “All those things are part of the park's design with historical elements woven into the landscaping.”\n\nIn addition, Woldorf said the park is designed to protect and preserve a large spreading white oak tree on the property. “We assume it’s a couple hundred years old,” she said. A second tree - a Hackberry -on the north side of the carriage house has been designated as a historic tree.\n\nThe park also contains a herb garden lush with plantings like thyme, rosemary, mint, sage, and more. A memorial tree and stone are also located at the park honoring the memory of the late Sue Turner, who served as council president from January 2022 to August 2022.\n\nGasper Landscape Design & Construction completed construction of the new park in mid-July, installing new fencing, paths, and benches; planting of trees and shrubs; and preparing planting beds.\n\n“We hope it will become the venue for small concerts where people can sit and listen. It’s going to be a very peaceful spot that will enhance the neighborhood,\" said Woldorf.\n\nThe borough, with the assistance of the Newtown Historical Association and private donations, purchased the property in 2019, saving it from being redeveloped by the former owners of the Bird In Hand. \n\nFunding for Patriots Park was provided by grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Keystone Recreation, Park and Conservation Fund; the Bucks County Municipal Open Space Program; the PECO Green Region Open Space Program; and local donors.\n\nThis is the second park spearheaded by Woldorf. She was also able to secure grant funding to landscape the Newtown Commons Park at the foot of West Greene Street. That project won the Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence.\n\n"},

The proposal is part of a resiliency blueprint that sprang up in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.\n\nDuring the now-infamous storm, the PVSC wastewater facility in Newark was flooded, spilling billions of gallons of raw or partially-treated sewage into the Passaic River. \n\nSince then, the PVSC has rolled out a sweeping \n\n to avoid future calamities. Part of that plan includes building a plant which would provide backup power to their wastewater treatment plant if the grid goes down.\n\nThe PVSC has maintained that the plant will use state-of-the-art emission controls and will have a “negligible impact to the community,” only being used as a backup when a storm cuts out power. Spokespeople have said the agency continues to explore clean energy alternatives for the facility, and is planning to integrate solar and batteries as part of the project. The agency said it is also working with Siemens – the manufacturer of the turbines that would be used to operate the facility – to transition the fuel used in the turbines from natural gas to a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen and then to 100% hydrogen. \n\nBut while advocates say they understand the need to build resilience in the face of the climate crisis, they insist that the PVSC should do so with a solution that “prioritizes as much renewable energy as possible and doesn’t involve a new “dirty energy power plant,” especially in a neighborhood that’s been long-plagued with environmental hazards – including several other power plants.\n\nThe proposal has seen pushback from several elected officials, including the Newark City Council and Mayor Ras Baraka.\n\n Now, two Green Party candidates are adding their voices to the mix.\n\n“It’s time we prioritize ethical, green, and renewable energy sources over profit-driven projects that harm vulnerable communities,” Khalil said. “I urge local officials to reject the proposal and protect Newark residents’ health and dignity.”\n\nSerrano said he “stands firmly” against the commission’s plan to build a power plant in the 10th District, which includes part of Newark in addition to other nearby municipalities.\n\n“The Passaic River is already plagued with severe pollution, and this project will exacerbate the environmental crisis,” Serrano said. “Newark and surrounding communities face unsafe drinking water containing cancer-causing chemicals. Adding further industrial strain is unacceptable.”\n\n“We need to prioritize the health of our residents and invest in sustainable solutions, not add to the pollution,” he added.\n\nA major rallying point for activists has been New Jersey’s landmark environmental justice law, which they allege that the plant would violate. \n\nUnder the law, an \"overburdened community\" must have at least 35 percent of households that are low-income, 40 percent of residents who are minorities or belong to a state-recognized tribal community, or 40 percent of households that have limited English proficiency.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) designates the Ironbound section of Newark as an overburdened area because it has a high percentage of low-income and minority residents.\n\nHowever, the NJDEP recently announced that the state will allow the plan to move forward, with Commissioner Shawn LaTourette saying the facility will be taking measures to reduce its environmental footprint, including better pollution controls on boilers that treat sewage sludge, replacing older equipment, and installing more solar panels and batteries. He added that there will be “no disproportionate impact” on minority communities. \n\nAfter the NJDEP announced its decision, a spokesperson for the PVSC gave Patch the following reaction:\n\nSeveral New Jersey state lawmakers who represent the area criticized the NJDEP's announcement, including Sens. Teresa Ruiz and Renee Burgess, and Assembly members Eliana Pintor Marin, Shanique Speight, Cleopatra Tucker and Garnet Hall.\n\n\"The NJDEP's approval of the PVSC power plant in the Ironbound neighborhood is an indefensible and hypocritical decision that blatantly violates New Jersey’s Environmental Justice Law,\" Ruiz said.\n\n\"The people most affected by this act will bear the health and psychological brunt, particularly the children who reside in these neighborhoods, unlike the decision-makers who remain comfortably detached from the consequences of their shocking and reprehensible actions,\" the senator added.\n\nThe Ironbound Community Corporation (ICC), which has been a vocal opponent of the proposal, blasted the NJDEP's announcement and questioned the sewerage commission's reasoning.\n\n\"The PVSC argues that an additional fossil fuel power plant in Newark is necessary to prevent power outages and subsequent street flooding,\" the nonprofit stated. \"Despite severe storms like Henry and Ida, which brought record-breaking rainfall to our neighborhood, PVSC has not suffered any power outages since Superstorm Sandy. Their assessment of alternatives, such as solar and battery storage, was conducted over a decade ago and did not account for the significant advancements in solar and battery technologies since then.\"\n\n\"It is morally irresponsible for PVSC to proceed with this fossil project amidst climate change, heat waves, and advancements in clean energy,\" charged Maria Lopez-Nunez, deputy director of organizing and advocacy at the ICC.\n\n\"Adding another power plant to our already burdened neighborhood is a racist decision that disregards community health and environmental justice,\" she said.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is currently accepting comments from the public regarding the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission’s application for a Significant Modification to its Title V Operating Permit. The modification would allow the Commission to operate the proposed Standby Power Generation Facility in accordance with the restrictions set forth in a draft permit proposed by NJDEP.\n\nThe public comment period runs from August 30, 2024, through October 29, 2024. For more information, see \n\n or call (609) 292-6722. Read the notice in Spanish \n\n.\n\nIn addition, the NJDEP will hold a public hearing on Oct. 1 at Sport Club Portuguese, 55 Prospect Street in Newark. The public hearing will start at 5:30 p.m. and end by 9:30 p.m. A virtual attendance option is available via \n\n.\n\n"},

Renovations included a new playing surface and hoops, as well as perimeter drainage to protect the harbor. Trees were donated by the Northport Native Garden initiative, Radman said. A separate fundraiser by the Louis J. Acompora Foundation was held to have a defibrillator installed in the park, Radman said.\n\nThe team's original blueprint also featured a rain garden and renovated bathrooms meant to \"complete the beautification\" of a portion of Cow Harbor Park, Radman said.\n\n\"The real dream is for this court to result in great Northport basketball players and teams,\" Radman told Patch. \"We’d love for people to say, 'Do you remember the Northport team that won the Long Island championship?' and they wouldn’t know who you were talking about because so many championships have been won, it’s become commonplace.\"\n\nThe basketball court renovations were first pitched in 2021 by the championship team, which began fundraising efforts to \n\n.\n\nSupport for the project was mixed, with opponents concerned over the character of Cow Harbor Park and how the court's increase in size would impact the facility.

The DEC said there was no indication of a petroleum release at the planned dig site and \"considers this matter resolved.\"\n\n\"DEC takes all reports of potential environmental contamination seriously and works to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations that are protective of public health and the environment,\" the DEC wrote in a statement.\n\nOn Nov. 29, 2023, the DEC oversaw the collection of soil and groundwater samples at Cow Harbor Park by Village of Northport and Town of Huntington consultants, the agency said. The agency said the soil boring was done in the same spot as the 2022 boring that indicated the presence of a petrochemical odor at the soil and groundwater interface just over 5 feet below the surface. Mixed sand, loam and gravel are above the water.\n\nThe 2022 boring study caused tension on the Northport Village Board. Then-trustee Ernest Pucillo notified the DEC of the petrochemical smell, leading the agency to oversee the recent boring, after he said the village did not report the issue or notify the trustees.\n\nDeputy Mayor Joseph Sabia was fired from his position at a Nov. 8, 2023 board meeting after Mayor Donna Koch said on or about Oct. 24, 2023, Sabia and Trustee Dave Weber were \"down in Cow Harbor Park, a clear violation\" of the village's open meetings' law. Sabia said the meeting was coincidental and not planned.\n\nKoch, at the board meeting, said Sabia and Pucillo's actions were \"nothing short of a coup d'é·tat\" against the village.\n\nBefore the DEC did its boring study, Pucillo, Sabia and some village residents expressed health concerns regarding the planned basketball court expansion, as the park is the site of a former LILCO power plant.\n\nPucillo previously said he was pleased that Cow Harbor is \"safe for renovation and public access.\"\n\n\"We can feel better that the people and children are not being exposed to any hazardous conditions,\" Pucillo previously said.\n\nKevin Kavanaugh, a Northport Village resident, \n\n in Cow Harbor Park. More than 1,350 people signed the online version, with more signing on paper, Kavanaugh said.\n\nKavanaugh previously said the expansion would result in trees being cut down and grass getting replaced with concrete, as well as \"jeopardize the natural charm\" of the park and \"impose financial burdens on taxpayers.\"\n\nSabia said he was never against the basketball court, though he was against \"the way it was rolled out.\"\n\n\"The mayor and board made a promise to the village taxpayers the court could be rebuilt as long it did not cost the village taxpayers 1 dollar,\" Sabia said. \"So, I voted no because it cost so far $35K and going higher. I think the court is beautiful, and I hope the children enjoy it for many years to come. But the next, time tell the village taxpayers the truth from the beginning.\"\n\nKoch did not respond to Patch's email request for comment.\n\nRadman said compromises were made to save certain trees after concerns from village residents.\n\n\"I would say thank you to anyone who provided their opinion whether for or against the court,\" Radman said. \"I think the village board did a really good job of holding multiple hearings and trying to listen to as many people as they could — and many compromises were made to result in this finished product. I’m glad people pointed out areas of concern for the plans because it caused everyone to take a careful look on exactly which trees could be spared and what is the ideal size to balance basketball play as well as the great charm of the park.

Tim Simenson looked into the trunk, Elton Williams shot Simenson twice in the face near Theodore Street and Burry Circle.", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/joliet/2-cop-killers-took-crest-hill-sgt-tim-simensons-life-30-years-ago", "article": "CREST HILL — This weekend marks the 30th anniversary that serves as a grim reminder of the dangers associated with being a police officer. \n\n was fatally shot several minutes after pulling over two armed robbers, \n\n and \n\nAt the time of the overnight traffic stop, Simenson didn't know about Williams. That's because Williams was hiding inside the trunk of Shaw's car, armed with a loaded rifle, ready to use it.\n\nAccording to court records detailing the 39-year-old police officer's murder, remembered by residents of Will County to this day, the following tragic events unfolded on Sept. 28, 1994:\n\nResident Bill Chaney began walking from the parking lot of the Arbor Club apartments to the entrance of his apartment building when he spotted a white car with the engine running, but nobody inside.\n\nSuddenly, Elton Williams, then 23, ran at Chaney with a .22-caliber rifle, demanding his wallet.\n\nThe victim gave up his wallet, then went inside and called 911 from his apartment complex.\n\nIt was around 12:25 a.m. \n\nUpon learning of the armed robbery from police dispatchers, Crest Hill Police Sgt. Simenson and Officer Tom Evanoff drove to the Arbor Court apartments, and they saw the robbers' getaway car leaving the parking lot.\n\nSimenson alerted dispatchers he was stopping the car near Theodore Street and Burry Circle. Another officer, Ralph Smith, later joined Simenson at the traffic stop. As for Evanoff, he initially went to the apartment building to speak with Chaney, before joining his fellow officers back at the traffic stop.\n\nOn Theodore Street, Officer Smith saw that Gregory Shaw, the driver of the getaway car used in the armed robbery, standing outside the car as Sgt. Simenson shined his flashlight inside the car.\n\nSimenson turned off the car and took the keys. He made Shaw go to the back of the car, and that's when Shaw disobeyed Simenson's orders, instead choosing to sit on top of the trunk.\n\nSimenson ordered Shaw to get off the trunk and stand by his parked squad car. \n\nAccording to court transcripts, Shaw slid down from the trunk, but remained there for a few seconds before finally leaving. Next, Simenson unlocked and opened the trunk, holding the keys in one hand and his flashlight in his other hand.\n\nOut of nowhere, Williams emerged from inside the trunk, firing his rifle. \n\nWilliams shot Simenson twice in the face. Williams then tried to shoot Officer Ralph Smith, but the gunman's rifle jammed. Williams jumped from the trunk and aimed his rifle at the other officers, and that's when Smith and Evanoff fired their guns, and they stopped firing once Williams fell to the ground.\n\nAt separate trials, juries found Williams and Shaw guilty of first-degree murder and armed robbery. According to testimony from ambulance paramedic Scott Shear, when he asked Williams why he shot Simenson, Williams answered that he did not want to go back to jail.\n\nWill County prosecutors revealed the criminal history of Williams included theft, robbery and gang activity. An inmate from Pontiac Correctional Center testified that Williams told him in the months leading up to the murder trial that Williams and Shaw planned to do the robbery and if the police stopped them, Williams intended to shoot them.\n\nCourt files indicate that Williams showed no remorse for shooting Sgt. Simenson, and he even wrote a song about the shooting.\n\nRetired Joliet Police Chief Fred Hayes, now police chief of Elwood, was one of a handful of area police officers responsible for visiting the Simenson house in Plainfield, informing Simenson's wife of her husband's tragic and senseless murder.\n\n\"Very sad,\" Hayes said, \"Very sad set of circumstances. Tim was a good friend of mine, and Tim worked some of the biggest drug trafficking cases in the Chicagoland area.\n\n\"Out of the Tim Simenson tragedy, the seeds of a legacy were born,\" Hayes explained. \"Because Tim did a lot of good, and his hard work, he passed that on, and we continued where he left off.\" \n\nHayes told Joliet Patch he was a very close friend of Simenson; the two worked on numerous Will County area undercover narcotics investigations. Simenson was responsible for sending dozens of high-level drug dealers to prison; making Will County a much safer place, Hayes said.\n\nAt the time of his death, Simenson was 39 years old. \n\nIn addition to being known as one of the top undercover narcotics investigators in the region, Simenson was an incredibly talented and aspiring writer, according to Hayes.\n\nSimenson once gave Hayes one of his book manuscripts to look over.\n\n\"Tim prided himself in that he was a heck of a writer. He aspired to write a book, and he shared with me a DOS manuscript. It was true crime,\" Hayes said. \n\nAs far as Simenson's writing pursuits, \"It was fiction and non-fiction writing. He was really good at it,\" Hayes said.\n\nEven though Simenson was promoted to Crest Hill sergeant, he continued to work with his police sources to gather information and leads for other criminal investigations even though he was no longer on the Joliet area drug task force, Hayes explained.\n\nJust days before his death, Simenson went out in the middle of the night to meet with Hayes about another undercover police investigation.\n\n\"Tim was always gathering information,\" Hayes remarked. \"He called me to meet him in the middle of the night. It was information on high-level gang activity. He worked closely with the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), ATF and FBI. He really dealt with some dangerous areas.\"\n\nHayes said that police officers everywhere changed their tactics and approaches to inspecting vehicles based on Simenson's tragedy.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Tim's tragedy has saved lives,\" Hayes reflected. \"Everyone reevaluated their training and tactics and something that was taught in police academies was this tactic, to double-check that trunk.\"\n\nHayes also pointed out that there are three high-profile officer deaths in the Joliet area that all happened exactly 10 years apart.\n\nForty years ago, Joliet police officer Marty Murrin was slain by Manuel Salazar on Sept. 12, 1984.\n\nThen 20 years ago, Joliet patrolman Jonathan Walsh died following a traffic crash on Aug. 20, 2004. Walsh was responding to a burglar alarm at Pilcher Park when an SUV collided with him, causing Walsh to crash into an unoccupied lift crane east of Briggs Street.\n\n\"We just had the 20th anniversary, the 40th anniversary and now the 30th anniversary,\" Hayes pointed out.\n\nWill County court records show that the post-conviction case for Elton Williams, now 53, has been dormant for years, but that is not true for Shaw, now 60. \n\nIn fact, Shaw, serving as his own pro se attorney from prison, has filed several documents this year with the Will County Courthouse. He has had multiple hearings this year, but none of his efforts to overturn his murder conviction for Simenson's death have been successful.\n\nShaw is now awaiting a ruling before the Illinois Court of Appeals Third Judicial District in Ottawa.\n\nHe was sentenced to life back on Jan. 5, 1996 and he is serving his prison term at the Menard Correctional Center. On April 10, Shaw wrote in his notice of appeal, asking that the Office of State Appelate Defender be appointed because \"appellant is indigent and has no attorney.\"\n\nShaw calls his filing \"Actual Innocence Claim.\" It's many pages of handwritten prose, and boils down to this:\n\n\"He obtained a sworn signed affidavit from his co-defendant Elton Williams that Shaw attached to his first pro se successive post conviction petition filed in 2013 in the Circuit Court of Will County which Elton stated in his affidavit that categorically and unequivocally that Shaw had no prior knowledge or planning in the armed robbery he had committed or of his actions when he shot and killed Officer Timothy Simenson. Elton Williams also admitted the gun used was his and Shaw had no involvement or planning that Williams was going to use the gun.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Hayes said that as far as he's concerned, Shaw is just as guilty as Williams, Simenson's actual killer, because Shaw knew Williams was hiding in the trunk armed with a loaded rifle and Shaw kept silent the entire time knowing Williams was lying in wait, ready to shoot at a moment's notice.\n\n\"For this to occur with two scumbag street-level criminals was absolutely shocking because most of us learned from Tim,\" Hayes said. \"So when this tragedy happened, it was difficult to see how a street-level group of scumbags could take someone like Tim down.\"\n\nOne year after Simenson was killed, current Crest Hill Mayor Ray Soliman, then a city alderman, along with several community leaders, raised thousands of dollars in donations to build a monument to remember Simenson as well as other fallen police officers.\n\nIn 1967, Crest Hill Officer James Nink also died in the line of duty. Nink was in a police pursuit of a burglary suspect about 15 miles west of Crest Hill, toward Yorkville, when he lost his life after crashing into the suspect's overturned car.\n\n\"We certainly wanted to honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice,\" Soliman said.\n\nSoliman was a Crest Hill police officer from 1980 until 1985. The Crest Hill Police Memorial is in addition to the Veterans Memorial that Crest Hill has to honor its military soldiers.\n\nIn 2023, both memorials were moved from their long-time location outside the Crest Hill Municipal Building off Plainfield Road to the new Crest Hill City Offices off Weber Road across the road from Siegel Farms.\n\n\"I worked with Tim for five years,\" Soliman told Joliet Patch on Thursday. \"We were good friends and he taught us a lot as a police officer. He was a great guy and we miss him a lot.\"\n\nAs far as the tragedy of 30 years ago, Sept. 28, 1994, \"that one hit me hard when it happened,\" Soliman said. \"We dedicated the Police Memorial during our Memorial Day ceremony on May 29, 1995. We then formed our veterans and police memorial committe which still stands to this day and we honor all of our veterans of the city of Crest Hill and our two slain police officers during our annual Memorial Day ceremony to honor and remember the sacrifices they made to improve the quality of life for all of our residents.\"\n\nPolice Chief Ed Clark said that Simenson's badge has been retired by the Crest Hill Police Department.\n\n"},

Maura Healey approved the Brookline law banning tobacco and vape sales to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2000, when she was the attorney general in 2021. Brookline's ordinance was the first law of its kind in the United States.\n\n\"In addition to preventing a new generation from being addicted to nicotine – and facing the long-term health issues that come with it – Brookline citizens who smoke will be further motivated to quit as smoking becomes rarer around them,\" said a \n\n at the time applauding the town's decision.\n\nBut the store owner coalition is calling on those opposed to the proposed bylaw to make their voices heard at the Peabody Board of Health meeting scheduled for Thursday at 4:30 p.m. at Peabody City Hall. Those wishing to watch the meeting can also do so \n\n (passcode 643100).\n\nThe retail coalition argues that the proposed ban \"haphazardly applies a discriminatory ban against the purchase of legal products by 21-plus adults, treating them differently from those born before them\" in a way that is \"fundamentally wrong,\" works to create a \"dangerous illicit market,\" and \"does nothing to address under-age youth use of nicotine and tobacco products.\"\n\n in April after the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the ban in neighboring Brookline.\n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/howell/howell-modifies-plans-soldier-memorial-park-upgrades", "article": "HOWELL, NJ — Plans to build restrooms at Soldier Memorial Park are on hold as Howell Township officials are revising plans for improvements under a grant the township received from Monmouth County. \n\nMatthew Howard, director of community development for Howell Township, presented a rough outline of the proposed revisions at the Howell Township Council meeting on Sept. 17, to finally put a $250,000 grant received in 2018 to use. \n\nHoward said the initial plans for the grant funding were to add lighting, a concession stand and restrooms to the park, the use of which has grown substantially over the last several years. Soccer, softball and other leagues use the fields regularly, and there are playgrounds at the park. The town also has begun using it regularly for events such as Howell Day last weekend. \n\nThe idea for a concession stand was dropped a few years ago, Howard said, as food trucks have filled that niche.\n\nThe issue of building restrooms remained a strong desire, including during discussions about the park and the grant in 2022. Howard said that when officials began to look more deeply into the potential for building restrooms — as opposed to the portable bathrooms brought in now for events — there were several issues, he said. \n\nFor starters the \n\n has asked the town to not try to connect to its sewer line in that area.\n\n\"There are questions about the suitability to tap into the (sewer) line,\" Howard said, because of issues with breakages that have been happening. \"The line might be getting replaced,\" he said but there was no timeline given. \n\nThe town also has looked into the possibility of putting in a septic tank-based restroom. Because of the level of use of the park, it would require a septic system that is much more extensive, Howard said. \n\n\"We can't just do a septic system like at home,\" he said. \"It would be multi-year permit process to essentially create a treatment system.\"\n\nHoward said the decision is to shelve the bathrooms for now \"because they are not a great use of funds or efforts.\"\n\nInstead, the grant funding will be used on other improvements to the park, including a paved walking trail around the property, instead of one with stones. Some of the fields on the complex would be graded to correct sharp slopes that make the fields unusable. \n\nHoward said they also are looking at storage buildings for the various leagues that use Soldier Memorial Park, along with shade structures, picnic tables and seating. \n\nFood trucks have filled the need that a concession stand was intended to meet, at a much lower cost to the township and taxpayers, Howard said. The town put in electrical hookups for the food trucks to use, and with the food trucks feeding hungry people at events, the town does not have the upkeep of a physical building. \n\nThere also are no issues with finding staff, a critical problem for many of the leagues who struggle to find enough volunteers as it is, he said.\n\nNo members of the public in attendance at the council meeting offered comment on the revised plans.

The town now has 120 days to reach an agreement with BPD Holdings – not 60, as per the original resolution. A complete application for preliminary and final site plan approval is due by June 1, 2025.\n\nIf the parties can’t come to an agreement, either can void the designation.\n\nA representative for the redeveloper answered questions from town council members at Tuesday’s meeting, noting that there are “a lot of moving parts” to the proposal, but BPD Holdings hopes to have a site plan filed by the end of the year with traffic and environmental studies – although that goalpost may end up getting moved back.\n\n“We’re trying,” she told the council.\n\nWatch footage from the Sept. 24 meeting below\n\nThe debate over the fate of Lackawanna Plaza has been in the works for nearly a decade, and the project has seen several stumbling blocks along the way.\n\nThe Montclair Town Council voted to designate the site as an “area in need of redevelopment” in 2015.\n\nFor years, The Hampshire Companies and Pinnacle Companies tried to breathe new life into the site, which is home to a historic former train terminal. After getting approval from the Montclair Planning Board in 2019, the companies announced that a 216,772-square-foot, mixed-use project was in the works, including residential, retail and office spaces.\n\nThe project was expected to kick off later that year.

Wolf said she wished the taxing bodies would coordinate their efforts in seeking increases. \n\n\"You cater to the younger generation buying million-plus homes, two salaries. They can afford it,\" Wolf said. \n\nLike others, Wolf questioned the need for a new police station. \n\nHowever, officials say the 34-year-old building suffers from security problems. They argue it was designed poorly. \n\nDuring Monday's public comments, other residents, including real estate agents, also spoke up.\n\nReal estate agent Joyce Okal said people moved to Elmhurst because it was a solid community with a mix of people. \n\nBut she said that's changed. With rising taxes, she said, \"you're forcing people out and not letting anyone young in.\"\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with this police station,\" Okal said. \n\nMichael Marchese, a third-generation Elmhurst resident, said he supported the police and was not a \"blue-haired liberal\" who belonged to the defund-the-police movement.\n\nStill, he said that if the city needed a new police station, \"there has got to be another way to do it.\"\n\nHe said he pays $8,000 a year in property taxes.\n\n\"C'mon, guys,\" Marchese told the committee. \"We're making the most money we've ever earned, and we're barely getting by.\"\n\nIn response to the residents, Alderwoman Noel Talluto, who heads the finance committee, noted the taxing bodies are separate. \n\n\"The park district referendum is weighing heavily on my mind these days,\" she said. \"It's not something we can control, but it's affecting every taxpayer in Elmhurst. We don't have the authority to tell other taxing bodies what to do.\"\n\nShe also said the water rate hike earlier this year came with a discount for low-income senior citizens.\n\nOkal asked Talluto, \"Basically, you have made up your mind on the police station. Basically, it's a done deal.\"\n\nTalluto said that was not the case, to which Okal responded, \"I disagree.\"\n\nOkal brought up \n\n, which is estimated to cost $47 million. She asked whether it was a done deal.\n\nTalluto replied that it was closer to being a done deal because of federal grants and already completed design work. \n\nThe city expected federal and other grants to pay for 80 percent of the project, with money from a local tax increment finance district covering much of the rest. \n\nAs for the police station, Mayor Scott Levin said the city needed a new one. He said it was either the oldest or second oldest in DuPage County.\n\nHe also referred to \n\n had far fewer square feet per officer than others in the county. \n\nOfficials said the building has been without air conditioning for eight years. From spring through fall, the city rents a chiller and connects it to the station's pipes. \n\nLevin said he saw a new police station as an officer recruitment tool. Prospective officers, he said, may be less inclined to join a police department with a rundown station.\n\nAt the same time, Levin said he understood why people opposed building a new police station because the current one looks nice on the outside. \n\nYears ago, before he joined city government, Levin said he thought Elmhurst was wrong to get rid of a fire station.\n\nHe said he later found he was incorrect. The station was poorly designed for a modern fire department, he said.\n\n"},

Coming in second is the city and library, at 11 percent.\n\nOne may think the relatively low tax rate means Elmhurst's taxing bodies are fiscally conservative and watch their dollars better than most others. \n\nThat may be the case, in part. But the city's analysis shows the towns with the lowest tax rates are among the wealthiest. They include Hinsdale, Clarendon Hills, Burr Ridge, Naperville and Oak Brook.\n\nThose with lower median household incomes typically have higher tax rates. They include Aurora, Hanover Park, Carol Stream, Woodridge and West Chicago.\n\nA town like Elmhurst has a large property tax base relative to its population. That base includes a thriving downtown, a retail corridor on Route 83 and an industrial park that city officials say is in hot demand.\n\nElmhurst's property tax base is 62 percent of Aurora's. But Aurora's population is four times Elmhurst's. That means Aurora has far less tax base per person. By contrast, Elmhurst enjoys a bigger base on which to tax. \n\nIn Elmhurst, a property tax bill is about 2 percent of a home's assessed value. In Aurora, the rate is 3 percent.\n\nWoodridge is another example. Elmhurst's tax base is more than twice Woodridge's, with Woodridge's population being three-quarters of Elmhurst's. In Woodridge, a property tax bill amounts to 3.2 percent of a home's assessed value.\n\nHinsdale taxpayers pay a lower rate than Elmhurst. On the DuPage County side of the wealthy village, a property tax bill works out to 1.7 percent of a home's assessed value. \n\nOak Brook is even better. The property tax bill is 1.3 percent of a home's value. The village government levies no property tax, thanks to sales tax income in the retail-heavy town. \n\nIn Elmhurst, the tax bill for a $500,000 house, which is about the median, amounts to $10,100.\n\n"},

The release is timely, as the next Diwali observance is on Nov. 1. \n\nDiwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated by multiple religions — Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some Buddhists. Variations of the holiday depend on the religion. Fairfax County Public Schools first \n\n in the 2022-2023 school year. \n\nTo write the book, Bhargava drew inspiration from her own experiences as a mom and former elementary school teacher. Rather than solely focusing on the religious aspects of Diwali, she wanted to share the cultural parts that feel inclusive and can bring people together. \" Since Bhargava has published it, \"A Kids Book About Diwali\" has been named the winner of the 2024 NYC Big Book Award in the Children's Religion category. \n\nPatch asked Bhargava to complete a Q&A to discuss the inspiration behind the book and more.\n\nBefore becoming a mom, I spent over 10 years teaching elementary school in Canada. Diwali has always been an important part of my life, but most people outside of the South Asian community knew little about it. While teaching, I created inclusive lesson plans that were eventually adopted by the Ontario School Board, incorporating Diwali into the curriculum. I also founded the first multicultural club in my school district, providing a space where children could feel seen, heard, and safe while celebrating their cultural heritage.\n\nWhen Diwali was officially recognized as a holiday by NYC last year, along with a growing number of school districts, including my own in Fairfax County, I saw the need for a book that not only explains the festival but also makes it accessible to children from all backgrounds. There was a lack of simple inclusive resources that could explain Diwali both at home and in the classroom. I wrote this book to help make Diwali more mainstream and to show that everyone can join in celebrating it.\n\nThere are many common misconceptions about Diwali. For instance, many people don’t realize it’s celebrated by over a billion people worldwide and across multiple religions.\n\nDiwali is like Christmas, New Year’s and Independence Day all together!\n\nThe book introduces the five days of celebration – each with its own meaning. Whether a child already celebrates Diwali or is completely new to it, the book simplifies the history and cultural significance in an inclusive way that’s easy for kids to understand and connect with.\n\nI can promise that no matter who picks up this book—whether it’s a child, teenager, or adult, and whether you’ve celebrated Diwali before or not—you’ll discover something new. Even after years of teaching Diwali, I learned something new while writing this book!\n\nWhen I was growing up, Diwali often felt isolating. I was the only one in my school who celebrated, and that sense of being different made me feel alone, like there was this big part of me that no one really understood. I never wanted my own children, or any other kids who celebrate, to feel that same sense of sadness and isolation. Writing this book was my way of creating something that could bridge that gap—so kids who celebrate feel seen, and those who don’t, can understand the significance of Diwali. My hope is that one day, wishing someone a Happy Diwali will feel just as natural as saying Merry Christmas. When people feel acknowledged and seen, it means so much to them.\n\nBelonging comes from feeling like all parts of yourself and your identity are seen. It's something I've been writing and talking about for some time. Understanding Diwali and its traditions not only helps kids who do celebrate feel like they belong in a community, it also helps all of us have more empathy and understanding for one another. I think most parents want their kids to learn these life skills at school and understanding Diwali is a part of building that empathy in kids and adults.\n\nWhen I was younger, I didn’t always feel that way, especially around Diwali. It’s why I’ve made it a personal mission to create spaces where everyone feels seen. With more schools recognizing Diwali, it’s a huge step in helping kids who celebrate feel that sense of belonging. But it’s also about teaching empathy and understanding for one another. When kids and adults learn about Diwali, they aren’t just learning about a holiday—they’re learning to appreciate and respect each other's differences. And I believe that’s something every parent wants for their children.\n\nIt took a lot of collaboration and support to bring this book to life. I was fortunate to work with an experienced publishing team at A Kids Co. and DK Penguin Random House, both of whom had a strong background in children's books. Being part of a series with over 170 titles also meant I had a solid foundation to build on. But beyond the professional team, I leaned heavily on my community—both parents and kids. They volunteered as early readers, providing invaluable feedback to help shape the story and ensure it resonated. My own kids and family played a huge part in this too, helping me craft the book in a way that felt authentic and meaningful.\n\nI also worked with several sensitivity readers to ensure the book was as inclusive as possible. Their feedback helped make the story respectable and accessible to readers from all backgrounds. And, of course, we went through a rigorous fact-checking process to make sure we got every detail just right!\n\nYes! The exciting (and sometimes overwhelming) part of writing a book tied to a holiday is that there’s a very specific window when everyone cares about it. As you can imagine, September and October are packed with events leading up to Diwali on November 1st (the date shifts slightly each year).\n\nI’ll be attending a Diwali celebration at the Kennedy Center, a Diwali Mela in Howard County, and visiting various elementary schools in the DMV as a guest author. In New York, I’ll be attending Mayor Eric Adams’ Diwali reception at Gracie Mansion, participating in literary festivals, and hosting events at the MOMA, CMOM, Asia Society, the Rubin Museum, Pier 57, and the NY Public Library. In New Jersey, I’ll be doing story time at the annual Diwali Play Date. I’m also collaborating with Diwali on the Hudson, a major fundraiser near Times Square, and the Boston Theater Puppet Show.\n\nOn top of all that, we’re working on an exciting promotion with Diwali Dance Fest hosted at Walt Disney World where dance teams from across the country will perform! \n\nAnd fingers crossed, I’m hoping to be invited to the White House Diwali Reception—it would truly be a dream come true for me!\n\nI absolutely love living in Vienna/Oakton! It’s a close-knit community where everyone feels connected, with a friendly small-town vibe and with access to everything you need. My family enjoys playing soccer at Nottoway Park and attending events on the Town Green. We love taking our Mini Goldendoodle J.J. for walks on the W&OD trail. For local favorites, the first place I check for recommendations is the Vienna Foodies Facebook Group by Lydia Russo! My go-to spots are 29th Parallel for coffee, Chit Chaat Café for snacks, Mama Tigre for its Mexican-Indian fusion, live music at Wolf Trap, and cocktails at Bear Branch Tavern. \n\nI love supporting local shops like Vienna Vintner and Wardrobe Rescue. The Farmers Market is a weekend favorite. It’s truly a wonderfully diverse place to raise a family, with great schools, beautiful parks, and a strong sense of community!\n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/holmdel-hazlet/see-life-legacy-bette-davis-new-one-woman-show", "article": "HOLMDEL, NJ — It was 2008 when actress Jessica Sherr said someone told her five fateful words:\n\n“You got Bette Davis eyes,” the person told her. \n\nSherr didn’t think much of it at first. It was only after she went home and searched for Bette Davis online that she began to see a resemblance.\n\n“I thought, ‘Wow, I guess I look like this young Bette Davis,’” Sherr said. “That’s when it started. I got hooked on her story.”\n\nKnown for films such as “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?” “All About Eve,” and “Dark Victory,” Bette Davis was an actress during Hollywood’s golden era in the 1930s and 40s. \n\nDecades after her career, Davis’ life and legacy have been captured in Sherr’s one-woman production “\n\n,” which will come to Bell Theater on Oct. 19.\n\nThe show, written and performed by Sherr, follows Davis on the night of the 1939 Academy Awards. Davis is nominated for Best Actress, but when the LA Times leaks the winners early, drama ensues. \n\n“I never thought it [the show] would be such an incredible success,” Sherr said. “It’s almost twelve years later, and I’ve performed over 400 shows across the country, 28 states, and three countries.” \n\nAlongside touring with her one-woman show, Sherr got acting experience on sets ranging from Marvel’s “\n\n” to TNT’s “\n\n.” Outside of TV, she was in an improv group called “The Jessica’s,” and got training in on-camera technique, scene study, and improv & sketch.\n\n“In the industry, as an actor, you have to find where you fit,” Sherr said. “And I definitely know I’m an actor who likes to produce. Instead of just being a funny redhead, I wanted to write myself something that was deep and challenging.” \n\nThat challenge came in the form of “Bette Davis Ain’t for Sissies.” \n\n“When you’re with an ensemble, you use each other’s energy to get through certain challenges,” Sherr said. “In this [her one-woman show], if anything goes wrong, it’s all on me.”\n\nWhile being alone on stage can be daunting, Sherr said her improv training is something that’s helped her in “an incredible way” throughout the production. \n\n“As a solo performer, if something goes wrong you ‘Yes, and?’ it,” Sherr said. “You just continue to these happy accidents. Happy accidents in solo shows tend to be kind of golden moments, and oftentimes, the audience doesn’t know.”\n\nOne such moment happened a few weeks ago when, during the show, Bette Davis’ Oscar fell off a table on stage. \n\n“Everyone in the audience said ‘Oh my gosh, an Oscar award fell down and you picked it up! You said you needed that Oscar. Was that written in the show?’” Sherr said. “It wasn’t. It was just the character – in the moment – said ‘I need my Oscar desperately,’ because she did. Bette Davis needed to have her Oscar.” \n\nAs Sherr went through the writing and rehearsal process for “Bette Davis Ain’t For Sissies,” she made it a priority to study Davis and find the most authentic ways to portray her. \n\nPart of this process was assisted by Kathryn Sermak, a friend and assistant to Bette Davis, who read Sherr's script and arranged a meeting with her. \n\n“I sat with her and we talked about my play and she advised me with what Bette would have done,” Sherr said. “Because she knew Bette. She lived with Bette for 10 years of her life.”\n\nAt the end of their meeting, Sermak gifted Bette’s scarf, handkerchief, gloves and earrings to Sherr to wear in her play. \n\n“Bette was a very generous person,” Sermak told Sherr. “This is a gift from her. Please wear it in your show.”\n\nSherr has worn the items on stage ever since. \n\n“It gave me a sense of knowing not to give up,” Sherr said. “When I put on that scarf and those gloves, I feel like there’s a part of her in me. And we are similar. We are both firecracker-y, both passionate, and both of us won’t give up.” \n\n“Those gloves go on, and I know there’s a piece of Bette in every show,” Sherr said.\n\nTo learn more about “Bette Davis Ain’t For Sissies,” you can \n\n. \n\n“Bette Davis Ain’t For Sissies” will come to Bell Theater on Oct. 19 at 7 p.m. \n\nBell Theater is located at 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel\n\n"},

He challenged more than 300 signatures on the petition, he said, for several reasons.

At the time, he had encountered a sense of defeat lingering in the area, remnants of communities scarred by the \n\n. Summit Hill District 161 takes in students from much of the same geographic area.\n\n\"Not a single person has answered and told me they agree with closing the schools,\" Oliphant said in February. \"Not a single person. These people are scarred from 210, and the closing of Lincoln-Way North.\"\n\nMany told Oliphant the parent group's efforts wouldn't make a difference.\n\n\"We choose not to accept that as fact,\" Oliphant said. \"We choose to keep fighting on behalf of the public and taxpayers.\"\n\nDistrict officials said at the time of the vote to close that they would consider either selling the properties, or working with community partners to ensure they would not go unused.

", "link": "https://patch.com/massachusetts/braintree/braintree-pay-14-9-million-man-wrongly-convicted-1980-murder", "article": "BRAINTREE, MA — Braintree officials have reached a settlement agreement with Fred Weichel, the man who spent nearly 36 years in prison for a Braintree murder he was later cleared of, for nearly $15 million.\n\nThe number was the source of much intrigue and concern for officials after, in 2022, a jury decided that he was owed $33 million despite Massachusetts law stating he was only eligible to receive up to $1 million from the state.\n\nWeichel was convicted in 1981 in the \n\n. He was 28 at the time of his arrest.\n\nWeichel was released in 2017 on bond in after a judge threw out his conviction and ordered a new trial. The Norfolk County District Attorney's Office in 2017 opted not to seek a new trial, citing a lack of evidence against Weichel.\n\nWeichel submitted the lawsuit against the Town of Braintree and the Boston Police Department in 2020, in which he contended that the town and police \"\n\n,\" and ignored evidence that would have cleared him of any wrongdoing.\n\nTo add to the intrigue of the case, Weichel said that, at the time, he was threatened by the infamous Boston mobster James \"Whitey\" Bulger. The Bulger storyline was discussed during testimony from Kevin Weeks, \n\nDuring his testimony, Weeks said that Bulger \"didn't really care for Freddy\", speaking of Weichel, and that on the night of the murder, Weeks saw Weichel at a South Boston bar, according to the Patriot Ledger.\n\n\"I knew it wasn't him, because he was in the bar,\" Weeks said in his testimony.\n\nBraintree Mayor Erin Joyce said a number of financial factors came into play when deciding to seek a settlement rather than allow a jury verdict to decide the number.\n\nThough state law protects Massachusetts from liability over $1 million, Braintree doesn't receive that same protection.\n\n\"Heading into settlement discussions with Mr. Weichel and his attorney, the Town of Braintree faced greater monetary exposure because of the uncapped liability and recent trends of large jury awards in similar cases tried against municipalities,\" Joyce said in the statement.\n\nEventually, the town decided on a settlement figure of $14.9 million.\n\nSome may question why the decision was made now, especially given Braintree's current financial crunch, which included layoffs and the town's affirmative vote for a Proposition 2 1/2 override, but officials said they believed it was in the best interest of the town to settle instead of risking a larger number from a jury decision.\n\nOfficials will work with a number of parties in the coming weeks to sort out financing and potential insurance coverage for the hefty payment.\n\nAdditionally, Town Council President Charles B. Ryan said they would continue working with Joyce in \"advocating for legislative reforms that will provide municipalities with the same protections from legal judgments that the Commonwealth provides for itself.\"\n\nIn addition to the statement offered by the town, Joyce also issued a quote about the case and settlement.\n\n“There are no winners with this case,\" said Joyce. \n\nShe continued:\n\n\"Mr. Weichel spent 36 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. He missed out on the opportunity to have a family, to travel, or to enjoy all the normal experiences of life we take for granted. Mr. Weichel was found innocent and wants to rebuild his life. In my judgment, the Town reached a sensible settlement with Mr. Weichel that is fair to him and prudent under the circumstances. To control the impact on our own financial stability going forward, we are aggressively pursuing insurance coverage collections with the help of our legal team, and we anticipate recovering a meaningful portion of this settlement.\"\n\nThe lawsuit named as defendants the town of Braintree, its police department, deceased former police Chief John Polio and several Braintree police officers, as well as several Boston and Massachusetts State Police officers.\n\nWeichel's attorneys said the Braintree Police Department withheld evidence that could have led to him being declared not guilty, and instead allowed a file with information about the investigation to sit in a basement for more than 30 years. Weichel made repeated requests for the police records while turning down offers for leniency as he maintained his innocence.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the defendants fabricated evidence against him to quickly solve the crime and fabricated a false witness to identify him. Four witnesses saw a man fleeing the shooting from 60 yards away and only saw the man for a few seconds, according to the complaint.\n\nOfficers testified that all four witnesses identified Weichel as being the man they saw leave the scene, when in reality, none of the witnesses were able to identify who they had seen, according to the suit.\n\nEleven witnesses told police officials they believed the man portrayed in a composite sketch was a convicted murderer who had not returned to prison following a work furlough, the suit said.\n\n Descriptions of the man's height and weight also matched that of the felon, but the lawsuit alleged that investigators suppressed their report.\n\nRead more: \n\n"},

Addison Township, which takes up the northern part of Elmhurst, is giving voters the opportunity. \n\nOn Nov. 5, a referendum asks voters to abolish Addison Township's road district and have the township government absorb its responsibilities. \n\nUnder state law, elected highway commissioners control township road districts without interference from township boards.\n\nAccording to the township, the road district maintains 28 miles of roads. Elected in 2017, Highway Commissioner Donald Holod makes $86,400 a year, according to the township records. That works out to $3,085 for every road mile. \n\nBased in Wood Dale, the road district spent $2 million during the 2023 budget year, according to the state comptroller's website. \n\nIn rural downstate areas, township road districts usually take care of many more miles of roads than their suburban counterparts. \n\nFor instance, Adams County in western Illinois consists of 23 townships. \n\n than Addison Township; most handle more than double. One of the two exceptions is Quincy Township, which overlaps Quincy, a town of nearly 40,000 that maintains nearly 190 miles of roads. \n\nIn the Chicago suburbs, towns, counties and the state own nearly all the roads, with little left for townships.

The band was headed to Greeley, Pennsylvania, for its annual band camp. \n\nThe \n\n of students on bus one and emotionally rocked the entire Farmingdale community, from current and former marching band students and faculty to parents and local business owners.\n\nThe marching band has exceeded every expectation since: it \n\n of the Farmingdale High School 2023 Homecoming just two weeks after the crash. \n\n\"This is definitely what [Pellettiere] would’ve wanted,\" Philip Sullivan, a senior trumpet player in the Farmingdale marching band, told Patch at last year's homecoming. \"I know she’s looking down on us right now, happy that we’re back performing, carrying on her legacy.\"\n\nThe band then performed at the \n\n — an event relished by Pellettiere — a month later.\n\nAnd then, perhaps most amazingly, students and faculty \n\n the year after the crash, never missing a beat.\n\nDefendini said each feat is \"impressive in its own way.\" He was \"wildly impressed\" at how quickly the students wanted to get back to performing right after the crash.\n\n\"I remember the crash happened on a Thursday,\" Defendini told Patch. \"It was less than a week later that I remember being in the band room and watching the kids practice and getting ready for the music. Within a very short period of time, they were playing again [at homecoming]. A week after that, they had their first performance. A couple of weeks after that, they had the Newsday Marching Band Festival. They got on the horse quickly just to get something going.\"\n\nDefendini said mulling over the decision to return to band camp a year later gave a lot of people \"a bit of a pit in their stomach\" about what the proper call was.\n\n\"I think it took a lot of courage, especially for the kids who were on bus one, to go back to band camp and do that whole thing again,\" he said. \"I don’t think I can rank [the milestones], but in their own way, they proved how profoundly resilient they were.\"\n\nBefore camp, the school's two band directors, David Abrams and Matthew DeMasi, met with their students in their musical rotations to discuss if they wanted to return to camp. Dalerettes coaches Lauren Scotti and Jessica Baker, as well as Daler Guard coach Shawnte Carter, did the same with their students, according to Defendini.\n\n\"It was pretty much a universal and collectively held belief that they needed to go back,\" Defendini said. \"The kids wanted to go back. The biggest concern we had was the bus itself.\"\n\nThe district gave students multiple options on reaching Greeley, Pennsylvania, for band camp, which was held Sept. 12 through Sept. 15. Many took a charter bus — the district used Coachman Luxury Transport after using Regency Transportation last year — and students were given the option to bring a parent or loved one with them before the guardian would immediately take the return trip home. Parents were also allowed to drive their children and other students to camp.\n\nIn late July, in direct response to the rollover, a \n\n in the mid-Hudson Valley area.\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer last year said the new gate will \"save lives.\"\n\n\"It took a horrific accident and horrific deaths, and almost a year later, they finally put in the crash gate,\" Farmingdale Village Mayor Ralph Ekstrand said. \"That was a good thing that came out of it.\"\n\nSome students decided to no longer be in the band after last year's events, Defendini said. Of the students who remained in the program, 100 percent of them went to band camp this year — even those who were seriously injured last year, he said.\n\nBand camp fostered an \"uplifting\" environment for all involved, Defendini said.\n\n\"It was a very cathartic moment,\" he said. \"It was an opportunity for them to turn the page and craft a new core memory. Band camp had always been a really special place for kids. The accident caused a bit of a rift in what they perceived band camp was, especially the kids who had never been there before — those freshmen coming up the ranks and even some of the eighth graders who became ninth graders this year — they never got a chance to experience it, and the only thing they’re left to think is based upon what they felt last year after the accident. There was this level of concern, I think, with regard to band camp about it being a safe place, a happy place. This year, making the decision to go forward with it was tough, but we’re so glad that we did, because they crafted those new core memories. They’re in a far better place than they were.\"\n\nDefendini knew he and his team would have to discuss the topic of band camp as soon as, not long after the crash, the Dalerettes were sifting through pillowcases donated to the district by a sewing group when one girl exclaimed, 'Oh my God, we shouldn’t use these. We should save these for next year's band camp!'\"\n\n\"And all of a sudden, Jed Herman, the principal sitting next to me, I looked at him and I was like, 'Guess we’re going back up to band camp,'\" Defendini said. \"I was like, 'Holy cow, it wasn’t even a second thought.' This girl, last year after the bus accident, immediately turned her head toward, 'We’re going back.'\" \n\nThe spirit that Pellettiere and Ferrari traditionally instilled in band camp was omnipresent over the four days, the superintendent said.\n\n\"That band is a family,\" Defendini said. \"That’s what it is at the end of the day and what makes it so special. Yeah, they play great music. Yeah, the marching band is fun to watch, and they do a great show. But the connections that are made at band camp come from the heart and soul of our band. And the heart and soul of band as long as I can remember, especially band camp specifically, was Gina and Bea. The two of them. They were the mom and grandma of band, and they created a family environment and a culture up there that made it really special. Something that kids really wanted to be a part of. That will live on forever.\"\n\nMiguel Hutchinson, a class of 2012 graduate who had Pellettiere in wind ensemble and marching band, said he cannot believe a year has already passed.\n\n\"I feel that Ms. P and Mrs. Ferrari live on through us,\" he said. \"Every person they met, every person they taught, every person they made laugh. We all continue their legacy by spreading the joy and laughter they gave us, to other people we meet.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, band camp had several traditions started by Pellettiere and Ferrari: DJ Night, karaoke, a students vs. teachers volleyball game, a basketball tournament, all of it continued this year. The only thing added was a ceremony on the first day of camp to celebrate the legacy of the band's matriarchs.\n\n\"That’s on their backs,\" Defendini said. \"That’s the traditions and culture that they created, and we maintained that. I think that’s their legacy.\"\n\nGabby Messina, who played clarinet in marching band in wind ensemble, had Pellettiere before she graduated in 2009. She said it is \"absolutely no surprise\" the students attended band camp a year after the \"horrific accident.\"\n\n\"Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, each of these students, staff and chaperones marched forward with great strength, bravery, and perseverance to keep this wonderful tradition alive,\" Messina said. \"Ms. P and Mrs. Ferrari would be so proud of these courageous human beings.\"\n\nHutchinson said the biggest lesson he learned from Pellettiere is to \"do what you love doing.\"\n\n\"You can tell Ms. P loved being a band teacher,\" he said. \"From conducting band with the seemingly superpower of being able to pick out who messed up, to being nervous with us during NYSSMA performances, or to times just hanging out in the band room. She was an incredible person, and it showed that she loved being a teacher.\"\n\nThe bus crash rocked the fabric of the entire community. The most tragic outcome, perhaps, was that Pellettiere was the single mother of a boy named Joseph, now 3 years old.\n\nDefendini said he has been in contact with Joseph's family.\n\n\"There’s a lot of love and a lot of support for him right now,\" he said. \"I don’t think that that’s going to wane. That love and level support, not just from our community, but his immediate family. That family, they are together and they are committed to making sure they can do everything they possibly can to make sure that boy has a wonderful, happy life. We’re going to make sure that we continue to stay connected to that family.\"\n\nThe district plans to support Joseph for years after the crash that claimed his mother.\n\n\"We’re not going to stop,\" Defendini said.\n\nAn outpouring of love came from the community after the crash — for Joseph and the marching band students injured physically and scarred emotionally.\n\nMariano Schwartz, a 17-year-old pianist who attends St. Anthony's High School, performs at 317 Main Street, a restaurant in Farmingdale, and donates 100 percent of his tips to various causes.\n\nWhen Joseph became orphaned by the tragedy, \n\n at the restaurant for Joseph's education. The first fundraiser he had for Joseph resulted in a sea of Dalers green filling the back room of the spacious restaurant's event space.\n\n\"I haven’t seen anything like it. Before or since,\" Schwartz said. \"The room was packed. I remember I walked in with my brother, and there were so many people in the room that we had to squeeze through people to get where you wanted to. It was crazy.\"\n\nThe unity shown by the community at the events was \"really beautiful,\" Schwartz said. The amount of people who went after Schwartz and his family posted the event on social media was \"amazing,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn’t know that many people were ever going to come. I want to thank everyone from Farmingdale from that day. I only just played the piano. It was really all the people who decided to donate who helped. The people who spread the message and told people to come. I think they did all the actual legwork.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the crash, community merchants rushed to create fundraisers for those impacted in the crash.\n\n, an island-wide initiative, was founded in response to the crash. Pizzerias, for one day, were asked to donate a portion of proceeds to a cause. More than $102K was raised, as proceeds went to five pools: the students who were critically injured, non-critically injured students, the families of Gina Pellettiere and Bea Ferrari, and the school for marching band equipment.\n\nJen O'Neill, owner of Step By Step Dance Studio in Farmingdale and a former Dalerette, \n\n for one of the students critically injured in the crash, along with the help of her charitable troupe, the Step By Step Dance Company.\n\n include Adventureland, the Farmingdale McDonald's restaurant on Route 109, Whiskey Down Diner, Uncle Joey's Rainbow Explosion, Lithology Brewing Co., Croxley's Ale House, Nicolette's For The Home, Bagel Boss, Vico, 317 Main Street, Flower Shop of Farmingdale, and more.\n\nThe unity shown by the Farmingdale community at that time is still felt a year later, Defendini said. He addressed the topic with the district's staff during the past Superintendent Conference Day.\n\n\"We’ve been through so much,\" he said. \"COVID, the sociopolitical issues going on in the world today, international issues that are resonating here at the local level, and then the bus crash. It seems from a school district standpoint, it seems we’ve been part of a dynamic that’s really pressed us and tested our ability to be able to stay together. I said to our team, 'I don’t think there’s a circumstance that I can promise you that anything’s going to be quiet anymore. But what this community has proven is that whatever is thrown at us, it doesn’t break us. It only brings us tighter. Every time we go through something hard, it just connects us a little bit more.' People realize, 'Hard things might come, but I’ll have my Farmingdale family with me, and it will be OK. I’ll get through it.'\"\n\nHe added: \"I think that’s what we sort of have to hold to. We’re not going to create a circumstance in which crazy is not going to be part of our everyday life. It will be. But we have each other. We’ve proven we’ve had each other for years on end. This last year, probably being the most profound. We’ve proven that if we do stay together, we work with each other, we love each other, we’re compassionate and we care about each other, then we can do it. We can do it well.\"\n\nComing together during a tough time is \"what Dalers do,\" Ekstrand said, noting Farmingdale has had other tragedies over the years, including the 2012 drag racing crash that \n\n on State Route 24 — or Conklin Street.\n\n\"Dalers have always come together strong in any type of problem that has arisen in unity,\" Ekstrand said. \"Daler Strong has come out and shows its Daler face, its Daler pride, helps everything out with the situation. Then it goes back to being normal, everyday life. Daler Strong comes out whenever it is needed and for as long as it is needed. Then, as life comes back to normal, Daler Strong comes back to normal ... It’s not that we’re not as unified or anything else, it’s Daler Strong comes out whenever it is needed.\"\n\nEkstrand said he hopes everyone stepping up in a show of \"Daler pride\" comes \"few and far between,\" noting the tragic nature of events that bring the community together. \n\n\"But it’s there and will always come out,\" he said.\n\nFarmingdale Village declared Nov. 17 \n\n and May 15 \n\n — the educators' respective birthdays — Ekstrand said. The families of the two teachers were presented with a village flag and citation.\n\n\"That’s what we did for their legacy to live on,\" Ekstrand said.\n\n"},

Anyone walking to school beyond that point would have to do so on the edge of Georgetown Pike, which gets very busy during the morning rush hour.\n\nThe alternative is to cross the busy road and take the asphalt path that worms its way through some woods to the high school. That is what Daniel was attempting to do on the morning of Aug. 21.\n\nFollowing the accident, Leonova contacted Dranesville Supervisor Jimmy Bierman's office, trying to raise awareness of the dangers facing pedestrians along Georgetown Pike.\n\n\"This situation is a clear consequence of the lack of a stop sign or a marked crosswalk at this intersection,\" she said, in an email to Bierman. \"Given the increasing traffic in the mornings and in the afternoon and ongoing presence of pedestrians, I believe installing a stop sign and a marked crosswalk at this location would significantly enhance safety for everyone. Several of our neighbors have expressed similar concerns, and we feel that proactive measures are necessary to prevent any other potential accidents.\"\n\nOn Leonova's behalf, the supervisor's office asked Fairfax County Public Schools to consider providing buses for students in the area due to the lack of crosswalks on the main road leading to the Langley High School, according to Prabha Rollins, Bierman's senior staff aide. \n\nThe supervisor also asked the police department to increase speed enforcement during school arrival and dismissal times. \n\n\"Supervisor Bierman has repeatedly made clear that he would support a speed camera in every school zone — the safety of our kids is too important, and he has no patience for motorists who break the law around schools,\" Rollins said. \n\nLast July, Fairfax County Police presented a plan that would add 50 more speed cameras near schools as part of the first phase of the expansion of the county's \n\n. \n\n\"While Langley High School was not identified by FCPD and FCPS as a proposed location for the next 50 speed cameras that are part of the Phase One expansion of the County’s speed camera program, Supervisor Bierman is interested in placing speed cameras in all school zones in the Dranesville District, and will suggest Langley High School for future expansions,\" said Ben Wiles, Bierman's chief of staff, in an email to Patch.\n\nAt the Dranesville supervisor's request, the Virginia Department of Transportation, which has authority over county roads, reviewed the area around the crash. \n\n\"They determined that a crosswalk cannot be installed at the Pine Valley and Georgetown Pike intersection,\" Wiles said. \"However, VDOT did find that the next intersection to the east at Mackall Farms Lane and Georgetown Pike meets the sight distance requirements and would be suitable for a crosswalk if a new ADA ramp were to be added to connect to the existing trail on the north side of the intersection. VDOT has begun working to implement this ramp and crosswalk. We do not have a timeline yet for when this work will be completed, but will continue to stay in contact with VDOT for updates.\"\n\nDaniel's recovery is expected to take about 10 to 12 weeks, and he will still need surgery, according to Leonova.\n\n\"The emotional damage, of course, is quite significant,\" she said. \"He's an athlete, and for him, it's just really devastating to be missing a good part of the hockey season.\"\n\nLast May, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors recognized the Langley Saxons ice hockey team for winning its third consecutive Northern Virginia Scholastic High School League Championship. Daniel \n\n at the government center to receive the proclamation from the board.\n\nDaniel also plays with Team Maryland, a youth ice hockey team based out of the Rockville Ice Arena.\n\n\"It feels a bit sad that my season is over,\" Daniel said. \"After getting hit. I remember immediately starting to say that my season is over upon seeing my leg, I just knew that this injury won't be quick to come back from.\"\n\n"},

A complaint filed last month on behalf of the administrator of the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission alleges four counts of misconduct involving three real estate transactions and record-keeping failures.\n\nThe allegations include instances of misusing client money from an interest on lawyer trust account, known as an IOLTA, which attorneys are required to use to hold clients' funds separately from their own.\n\nIn April 2022, while representing the seller of a home in Lake in the Hills, Sander took a $7,500 check from a buyer to hold as earnest money until the deal closed. \n\nThe next month, the account balance dropped by about $1,780, even though the money had not been disbursed and the closing had yet to take place, according to the complaint, which alleges that Sander used the money for unauthorized personal or business expenses.\n\nIn June 2022, Sander deposited $12,998 in his IOLTA, money supposed to be held in escrow to be released under the terms of a proration agreement pending the release of a tax bill, according to the complaint.\n\nBut the next month, before any of the escrowed funds had been disbursed, Sander's account balance had dropped by about $2,680, it said.\n\nAgain, state attorney regulators allege that Sander used the money for his own improper ends.\n\nA third real estate transaction described in the \n\n involves the purchase of a home in Arlington Heights. \n\nIn January 2023, a client of Sander's gave him $5,000 for the purchase of the house. But when the time came to close in March 2023, his IOLTA account was about $1,4000 short, the complaint said. \n\nAttorney regulators also allege that Sander failed to properly maintain required records for his IOLTA account during the period in question — April 2022 and March 2023 — in violation of another Supreme Court rule, in addition to the one that forbids \"conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\"\n\nIn response to an inquiry from Patch, Sander admitted misappropriating his clients funds from the IOLTA account because he needed money to pay for his suburban single-family home and private school for his two children.\n\n\"I was in a tough spot and had to borrow money from my IOLTA to pay my mortgage and kid’s tuition,\" Sander said in an email. \n\nIt is not possible to legally \"borrow\" money from an interest on lawyer trust account, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nSander blamed a client's lack of money for triggering the discovery of his misconduct.\n\n\"One check that was deposited into my IOLTA on behalf of a client bounced, which threw the balance off and caused a second check to bounce and cause this situation,\" he said. \"Every last dime was returned to the account and not a single person was harmed.\" \n\nSander has not yet filed an answer to the ARDC request for hearing before a disciplinary panel, where findings will be made and disciplinary action, if warranted, will be recommended. \n\nHe is entitled to present a defense during the proceedings.

When the times matched, I got excited. I may have seen condors! I will definitely be looking out for them now and paying closer attention. A condo of condors is just not something you see every day in the Mount Diablo area.\"\n\nIt was confirmed that on Aug. 18, seven \n\n flew north into Alameda and Contra Costa counties on a circuitous aerial tour, the Walnut Creek-based nonprofit organization Save Mount Diablo announced Monday.\n\nThe condors took a three-hour flight, departing at noon from their overnight roost site south of Ohlone Regional Wilderness. They soared over Pleasanton and Sunol, near the intersection of Highways 580 and 680 — the furthest west the birds have flown in the East Bay. \n\nAfter flying over Dublin and Tassajara, the birds ventured north over Mount Diablo’s Pine Canyon near Castle Rock—a possible future nesting site and where Save Mount Diablo previously helped reestablish endangered peregrine falcons—and as far north as Lime Ridge Open Space west of Clayton before veering east—the furthest north the birds have flown in Contra Costa County.\n\nThe birds circled Mount Diablo before heading south over the outskirts of Livermore and then spending the night in the mountains near Lake Del Valle. The condors, fitted with radio and GPS transmitters, did not appear to have landed during their time in the area.\n\nHow does Save Mount Diablo know all of this? Wildlife biologist Joseph Belli, a volunteer for the California condor recovery program at Pinnacles National Park, also works closely with Save Mount Diablo and pays special attention to birds ranging up and down the Diablo Range.\n\nThe condors' flight paths are tracked via GPS and highlight the vital role the Diablo Range plays as a wildlife corridor.\n\nSave Mount Diablo, which recently expanded its geographic scope to 12 counties, has been instrumental in supporting these efforts, funding GPS transmitters and data subscriptions that allow for detailed tracking of the condors’ movements.\n\n\"We would rarely know of these long-range flights if it weren't for the GPS transmitters on some of the condors,\" said Alacia Welch, the Condor Program Manager at Pinnacles National Park.\"I've been monitoring condors for nearly 20 years and it's wonderful to see groups of them exploring further north in the Diablo Range every summer for the past four years. I wouldn't be surprised if these summer forays continue into the future, so all you eagle-eyed condor enthusiasts should keep an eye to the sky!\"\n\nIf the Aug. 18 flight sounds familiar, it’s because a very similar event occurred around this time last year when six condors undertook an exploratory flight near Mount Diablo. It was the first flock in Contra Costa County in 100 years. Two of them—No. 1021, a 3-year-old male, and No. 943, a 6-year-old male—were also among this year's group. California Condor No. 943 made news in June 2022 for making a solo flight near Brushy Peak, the second condor documented in the area in over a century after Condor No. 828’s ground-breaking journey in August 2021. \n\nThe other five—Nos. 1099, 827, 912, 986 and 1078—were a mixture of juveniles and young adults, both male (Nos. 827, 912 and 986) and female (Nos. 1099 and 1078). The younger age group tends to undertake ambitious discovery flights, while older condors with nesting territories tend not to wander as extensively. Condors can begin breeding as early as 5 years old but generally wait until they’re at least 6 and often much older before nesting. No. 827 was the oldest of the group, an 8-year-old male who has not yet found a mate. \n\nThe group is also a blend of condors raised in captivity—Nos. 1099, 827, 986, and 943—and products of wild nests—No. 1021 from southern San Benito County and Nos. 1078 and 912 from Pinnacles National Park. Pinnacles and Ventana Wildlife Society co-manage the flock, managing release sites and monitoring the birds from the park and Big Sur.\n\nBecause there are so few condors, each one has a radio transmitter and is essential to the overall population. This allows the birds to be tracked if necessary. \n\nLess than half the flock also wear GPS transmitters, though most Pinnacles birds do thanks, in part, to Save Mount Diablo. In the last few years, the organization has funded additional GPS transmitters and subscription services for Pinnacles birds with grants from its Mary Bowerman Science and Research Program. The transmitters and subscription services allow precise flight tracks to be monitored and recorded.\n\nCondors prefer to fly over undeveloped areas. The theory in making the grants for GPS transmitters and subscriptions, especially for young birds, was that their GPS flight tracks would define and highlight the importance of the giant Diablo Range as habitat for the birds—200 miles north-south and 3.5 million acres of high-quality intact habitat. The theory is proving to be true.\n\nAccording to the American Bird Conservancy, California condors are \n\n. Their current population is around 504, and it is trending upward.\n\nThe central California flock consists of roughly 100 free-flying condors, ranging from north of Paso Robles and San Luis Obispo to southern Santa Clara County and occasionally beyond.\n\nThat number will increase toward the end of the year when 10 to 12 young condors raised in captivity will be released. \n\nIt’s also been a banner year for nesting, with a record nine chicks potentially ready to fledge in fall. The growing population bodes well for the future and the likelihood of more frequent condor appearances in the East Bay.\n\nAs \n\n continues to expand its efforts across the Diablo Range, its focus remains on ensuring that wildlife connectivity persists for future generations. The nonprofit group believes protecting these lands is crucial to the survival of California's most iconic species.\n\nALSO SEE:\n\n"},

I wanted to change that — and include everyone.\"\n\nTo that end, each painting title also conveys what the painting says in Braille, so viewers who can't read Braille can understand, she explained.\n\n\"Each visual element connects with the message. Through allowing my work to be touched, I have been given the joy of meeting so many more people and non-profits organizations that have bettered myself as a person, but also an artist.\"\n\nAlthough she had been showing her artwork from a very young age, Sheehan described the moment that changed her life's direction.\n\n\"It was almost 10 years ago when I was inspired by a man who couldn't see. He was attending an art fair where I was showing some work. His partner left him standing in one spot while she enjoyed herself shopping around at different booths. When she was done, she came back and guided him away. After they left, I was still thinking about him. I started to teach myself Braille that week and debuted my first Braille collection, 'Faces That Have Seen' later that year.\"\n\n For more information or to RSVP, please contact \n\n. \n\n\"Don’t miss this opportunity to engage with art in a whole new way,\" Sheehan said.\n\n"},

But the damage has already been done, advocates say.", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/westorange/outrage-new-jersey-over-racist-claims-trump-vance-update", "article": "ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — New Jersey is home to the fourth-largest population of Haitian residents in the country. And according to several community activists and religious leaders, former president Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. JD Vance have painted a target on their backs with their “false, dangerous and racist” claims about immigrants eating dogs and cats.\n\nIf you’re following the 2024 presidential election, you’ve probably heard the now-infamous claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, which Trump made during his recent debate with vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nLocal officials and city management have roundly dismissed the rumors, with \n\n that people’s pets are being consumed in Springfield. Ohio governor Mike DeWine – a Republican – has bluntly \n\n “a piece of garbage that was simply not true.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, Vance – who helped to spark the controversy with a \n\n a day before the debate – has \n\n that it’s possible that “all of these rumors will turn out to be false.”\n\nA wave of outraged advocates and Haitian residents across the nation have been decrying the pair’s comments as “racist” – including in Essex County, which is home to one of the highest percentages of Haitian immigrants and Haitian-Americans in the state.\n\nEarlier this month, city officials in East Orange, the National Association for Haitian Elected Officials Network (NAEON) and local community leaders gathered for a press conference at City Hall to hit back at Trump and Vance for their comments. \n\nTwo more social justice groups in the Garden State have since added their voices to the chorus: Faith in New Jersey and Resistencia en Accíon New Jersey.\n\n“Although New Jersey is home to the fourth-largest population of Haitian residents in the country, their plight is often not championed by all of our electeds and they – like most Black immigrants – are erased from the immigrant justice fight by the media,” said Charlene Walker, executive director of Faith in New Jersey.\n\n“As people of moral conscience, we will not stand idly by while our siblings have a target placed on their backs by the Trump/Vance campaign,” Walker added.\n\nAna Paola Pazmiño, the executive director of Resistencia en Accion NJ, said that an attack on one group of immigrants is an attack on all immigrants.\n\n“Here in New Jersey, we have witnessed the risk that these false allegations of eating pets in Ohio puts on Haitian community members who are expressing concern on the stigma that this puts on them,” Pazmiño said.\n\nThe blowback has also picked up attention from U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11), one of the co-sponsors of \n\n, which condemns the \"racism and bigotry\" unleashed towards Haitian people in the wake of Trump and Vance's claims.\n\n\"Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are intent on dividing Americans – pitting us against each other and sowing chaos for their own personal, political gain,\" Sherrill said. \"Now, after spreading blatant lies and misinformation about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, the community is reeling – shutting down schools, government buildings, and community events due to bomb threats and other public safety concerns.\"\n\n\"This is reprehensible and dangerous – and has caused pain and fear among the Haitian American community in New Jersey,\" the congresswoman added.\n\nOn Monday, the Rev. Niles Wilson, a Newark native who serves as pastor at Greater Cornerstone Baptist Church in East Orange, penned an op-ed he titled “The Deafening Sound of Silence.”\n\nWilson’s letter follows below:\n\n\"It's been three years since Texas border agents chased Haitian migrants on horseback using their reins as whips to threaten the asylum seekers with the type of violence they were originally fleeing from, all in an effort to keep them from crossing into the U.S. Fast forward three years and we see political candidates running for the highest office in the country, spewing outrageous and false claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting pet dogs and cats and eating them. Numerous fact-checks and recants of these claims hasn't stopped Trump or his vice-presidential running mate from perpetuating this lie. Their dangerous political rhetoric has incited threats and violence against the Haitian community in Springfield and beyond.\n\n\"It's bad enough for political candidates to lie, but when those lies stoke the flames of America’s long-standing issue of racism, the consequences are devastating. The spread of these falsehoods has led to increased hostility, forcing schools in Springfield to close and local government operations to grind to a halt. This reckless rhetoric is not just a lie; it’s a lit fuse that threatens to ignite deeper divisions, hatred, and violence across the country. As if to add insult to injury, Mr. Trump has pledged to deport Haitian migrants in Springfield if elected, despite the fact that they are legally residing in the United States.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is yet another blatant example of systemic racism in America. Racism is our nation’s Achilles’ heel, perpetuated by white supremacy and by those who seek to stoke fear among white Americans, blaming people of color for their problems. The attacks on Haitian immigrants and the Haitian American community are part of a long history of vilification of Black and Brown people in this country—a history that goes back centuries and continues to echo today.\n\n\"Haiti, in particular, has been a target of white supremacy ever since General Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared the country’s independence from France in 1804, establishing the first independent Black nation in the West. American slaveholders feared that Haiti's success would inspire a similar uprising in the U.S., leading the U.S. military to intervene in Haiti 17 times between 1862 and 1915. While these attempts to overthrow Haiti's government failed, the economic destruction that followed left the country in ruins. Haiti was forced to pay 90 million francs (21 billion in today’s currency) in reparations to France for its independence—a crippling debt that wasn't paid off until 1947. Even then, the country remained economically shackled because they were forced to take loans from other nations when they couldn't pay their debts. Leaving them owing millions in interest to the U.S., payments that helped build American wealth while keeping Haiti impoverished.\n\n\"Today, Black and Brown immigrants, like those from Haiti, are demonized in the U.S. Political leaders, including the former president, use their presence to spread fear, promising mass deportations despite their legal status. Yet according to migrationpolicy.org, 4.7 million European immigrants live in the United States as of 2022, but they face none of the demonization or deportation threats hurled at Black and Brown immigrants. This is an alarming double standard. No immigrant legally residing in the U.S., regardless of their race, should have to live under the threat of deportation or violence at the hands of racists.\n\n\"Now is the time for municipal, state, and national leaders from all political backgrounds to unequivocally denounce this rhetoric. Political leaders must stand with religious, academic, and business communities in supporting Haitian immigrants and the larger Caribbean diaspora. The silence from these leaders is deafening, and the unchecked actions of white supremacists are growing bolder. No more! Why has America abandoned its promise to welcome ‘the tired, the poor, the huddled masses?’ This country was built by immigrants, including Black and Indigenous peoples—the very groups Trump now vilifies, who were exploited, oppressed, and terrorized by colonists.\n\n\"This hatred is the direct result of systemic racism. It is born of the belief that people with Black and Brown skin are inherently less deserving of dignity, opportunity, and safety. Haitians, like many other people of color, are unfairly persecuted simply because of their skin color. They are criticized, demonized, and vilified for seeking a better life in America—something white immigrants have done for centuries without facing such hatred. Haitian Americans and immigrants have significantly contributed to the United States in various fields, enriching the nation’s culture, politics, science, and arts. We are thankful and proud of Ambassador Patrick Gaspard, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, Harvard President Claudine Gay, Dr. Pierre-Richard Cornely, Businessman Daymond John, Activist Fabienne Jean, Tennis Player Naomi Osaka and Sergeant Philippe Morgan to name a few. ”It is time for all of us, as Americans, to reject this hateful rhetoric and stand up for what is right. We cannot remain silent while political leaders and white supremacists spread fear and lies about immigrants of color. We must demand that politicians, business executives, clergy members, teachers, and community leaders speak out against this injustice. Silence is complicity.\n\n\"We stand in solidarity with our Haitian brothers and sisters. We reject the blatant lies being irresponsibly spread by the former president and his running mate. America is better than this. We deserve better than this. It’s time to raise our voices and demand a nation that truly lives up to its ideals of liberty and justice for all.\"\n\n"},

He was unable to recover from his injuries, and we made the difficult decision to humanely euthanize him, so that he would not suffer any longer. He had a fractured femur bone when he was brought in.

The woman, who had been dating Cutting for several months, accused him of assaulting her, choking her, and throwing her by the neck after she reportedly came home late from an errand. The woman fled the home, and a state trooper met with the victim at the Polar Caves park to take her statement. \n\nThe state trooper, according to an affidavit, reported blood on the victim’s face. She was evacuated from the area and placed in a Concord hotel. \n\nState police scheduled to pick him up on the warrants Monday morning before work, but the warrant arrest did not occur.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Cutting learned the victim was in Concord and was accused of attempting to get her to leave the hotel. State police found out he was at the hotel and organized a team of officers, including Concord police, to arrest him.\n\nNews 603 posted a video from NHTI on Facebook: \n\nCutting, realizing there were police at the hotel, fled the scene and led troopers on a chase through the city, according to state police. Concord officers also began scouring the city, searching for the suspect.\n\nOne state trooper later found Cutting’s abandoned pickup truck on the campus of NHTI-Concord’s Community College. \n\n“NHTI was temporarily placed into a shelter-in-place as law enforcement launched an immediate search of the campus and surrounding woods, where Cutting was located on a walking trail adjacent to Interstate 393 eastbound and taken into custody,” Tyler Dumont, a public information for state police, said. “After confirming he was not in the vehicle, a state trooper was able to reach him by cellphone.”\n\nA state trooper was heard assisting in the capture of Cutting on Monday night:\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, Cutting was found and arrested on disobeying an officer, reckless operation, and two reckless conduct charges. He was held on preventative detention and arraigned by video Tuesday in Plymouth District Court. \n\nJudge John Boyle warned Cutting not to speak about the case since he was not represented by an attorney at the hearing. A public defender could not attend, he said. \n\nAmanda Jacobsen, an assistant county attorney at Grafton County Attorney's Office, requested Cutting be held because he was a danger to the public, the victim, and law enforcement. She rattled off several prior convictions during the past two decades, including multiple reckless conduct with a deadly weapon, criminal liability for the conduct of another, and criminal mischief charges in New Hampshire. According to superior court records, those crimes occurred in Plymouth and Rumney in November 2003. Other convictions included 11 other felonies in Texas — felony domestic violence in 2011, evading detention, violation of a protective order, attempted firearm possession charges in 2016 and 2017, unauthorized use in 2019, and a drug conviction in 2020, which he was out on parole for. \n\nJacobsen said the state of Texas may issue a detention order against him. \n\nJacobsen accused Cutting of lifting the victim “by the neck” and throwing her onto a bed. Later, she lost consciousness, she said. At one point, Jacobsen added, Cutting had his knee on her back, pinning her against the ground, and the victim thought her neck was going to snap. The victim told investigators her teeth cut her mouth during the encounter. She accused Cutting of not letting the victim leave, but she was able to escape the home and report the incident to state police. \n\nCutting shook his head and put his face in his hands during the hearing. Later, he sat and stared at the ceiling. \n\nJacobsen also accused Cutting of driving between 70 and 100 mph on Concord city streets and highways while trying to flee from police on Monday night. She accused him of being clocked at more than 100 mph on Interstate 93. Video from a dashcam on Fort Eddy Road reportedly recorded part of the chase, including the suspect driver driving the wrong side of the road with state troopers chasing him, was posted to the \n\n.\n\nCutting said he had an ailing parent and pets, as well as a job, and beyond a driving incident, had not had any issues and checked in with his parole officer, as required. \n\nBoyle, after a few minutes, said the probable cause documents and Cutting’s parole status made him a danger to the public and a flight risk, and he was held on preventative detention. \n\nCutting is back in court on Sept. 30.\n\nAnyone with additional information to assist the investigation is asked to contact Sgt. Sean Smarz at 603-892-5512.\n\n"},

The results for math were even year over year, while also being well off 2019 scores, while science scores increased slightly year over year.\n\nIn English, 39 percent of students in grades 3 and 8 passed in 2024, compared to 42 percent in 2023 and 52 percent in 2019. For 10th-graders, 57 percent passed, compared to 58 percent in 2023 and 61 percent in 2019.\n\nMath scores were even at 41 percent for third and eighth graders in both 2023 and 2024, compared to 49 percent in 2019.

MCAS data provide just one snapshot of student performance. The fact that MCAS scores from the spring are just now being released demonstrates how the exam is not designed to allow educators and districts to take immediate action to support students.\"\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers Massachusetts President Jessica Tang called the MCAS a \"punitive and narrow test-based system.\"\n\n\"It's concerning that the state continues to use an accountability system that is obviously not working — one that is punitive toward the students with the highest levels of need, one that only exacerbates the achievement gaps we're seeing between students in our cities and their peers in wealthier suburbs,\" she said.\n\nThe MTA said using the MCAS scores to rank schools against each other in the years following COVID-19 \"will return us to a time when one's ability to get a quality, public education was wholly reliant on their zip code.\"\n\nThe MTA is in favor of Question 2 eliminating the MCAS as a graduation requirement if they are to be administered at all.\n\n\"Removing the MCAS graduation requirement is one way that the exams can be placed in their proper context,\" the MTA said. \"Incorporating MCAS scores alongside results from other assessment tools routinely used by educators will provide more accurate and actionable information about student performance.\"\n\n"},

On the front page of the first issue, the newspaper \n\n of a Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy poll under the headline: \"Fairfax City Voters Support Non-Partisan Elections.\"\n\nAlthough the brief story accompanying the results mentions the poll had been done on behalf of Fairfax Commonsense, it does not explain what that entity is. \n\nIn addition to the candidates already mentioned, there are other candidates on the official ballot running as independents who have not been endorsed by the City Democrats or included in Independent Fairfax City. \n\n and \n\n are running for the city council and \n\n, \n\n, \n\n, Sarah Kelsey and \n\n are in the school board race.\n\nThe Fairfax Independent included responses from Bonane and Ryan among the candidate questionnaires it published in its first issue.\n\nVoters across the political spectrum will decide whether a political endorsement by a political party or the political action committee of a former elected official makes a candidate partisan or not, as well as whether that matters. \n\nFor some candidates, though, it is a very serious concern.\n\nUnder the \n\n, federal employees are prohibited from taking an active part in the \"political management or political campaigns (i.e., engage in political activity in concert with a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group).\"\n\nConsidering federal employees make up a large portion of the region's workforce, many potential candidates would not be able to run for local office if the election was partisan. \n\nThat could mean some of the candidates who may have the same political views as candidates endorsed by the City of Fairfax Democratic Committee, are running as nonpartisan, independents on the city ballot because that's what they're required to do.\n\nCouncilmember Tom Ross is not seeking reelection this year.

My colleagues and I voted unanimously to put in motion a process to ensure that the residents of Princeton will be in the driver’s seat to determine the future of this critical property,” Council President Mia Sacks said. \n\n“Our town has many pressing educational, recreational, and municipal facilities needs. The opportunity to acquire this key site for public use was not one that we could, in good conscience, walk away from. We know that current residents and future generations will benefit from our willingness to act boldly to protect the public's interest.” \n\nThe WCC is currently the subject of several lawsuits including \n\n who opposed the move to Lawrenceville. \n\nAnother suit filed by the Princeton Theological Seminary cites the 1935 donation of the WCC property by Sophia Strong Taylor as a gift to advance the “training of Ministers of Music of Evangelical Churches.” \n\nHowever, if Westminster does not use the property for this purpose, “the land by the unequivocal terms of Ms. Strong Taylor’s gift would become the Seminary’s property,” the lawsuit says. \n\n During Monday’s meeting, the attorney handling the acquisition for the Council addressed the issue. \n\n“Municipality’s right to acquire that property either through private sale or through condemnation is not impeded at all by any of the claims made in the ongoing litigation,” the attorney said. \n\n“The Municipality is free to acquire the property and ownership is free to convey that property - that’s clear through the current litigation, that's clear through the law.” \n\nDuring public comment, a member of the Westminster Community Orchestra appealed to the council and community to keep the existing music facility in place when the property is acquired. \n\n“The music history, the music facility and the music people in Walnut Lane are an asset for Princeton, not a liability. I think this council should keep this in high regard,” the speaker said.\n\nHistorian and preservationist Clifford Zink congratulated council for taking the step to acquire the property and offered some advice. \n\n“When the town actually acquires the property I think it’s very important to get all the architectural records, not the records for the actual operation, because there will be a lot of information in there,” Zink said. \n\nHe also urged the council to “be creative in repurposing” the site. \n\nAfter the public comment section, Councilwoman Michelle Pirone Lambros reassured residents that there would be a proper planning process in place for the site. \n\n“We are hearing some concerns, some good ideas, some comments and a lot of questions. Just a reassurance that we are not yet at the point in the process, but when it’s appropriate there will be a robust planning process that will incorporate stakeholders and the community,” Lambros said. \n\nPublic hearing on the \n\n to the amount of $50 million to buy the property will be held on Oct. 14.\n\n"},

But for years, La Grange has made exceptions. Since 2005, the majority of new commercial buildings have been four or five stories high, the village said. They have been near the train. \n\nIn June, the board approved \n\n on Hillgrove Avenue, despite neighbors' opposition.\n\nAt Monday's meeting, Kuchler said developers know La Grange has five-story buildings. But he said the code allows the village to address neighboring homeowners' concerns about buildings' height. \n\nTrustee Beth Augustine said if the village allows five-story buildings, they should be along the BNSF railroad corridor. And Trustee Glenn Thompson said certain areas proposed for five-story buildings make no sense. \n\n\"We need to refine that much better,\" he said. \n\nMichael Blue, a Teska Associates consultant who helped draft the long-term plan, said the five-story proposal would still require a review.

This is the third such drill happening with the hospital’s affiliates. Drills were also held in Franklin and Laconia earlier this year.\n\nJohn Duval, the hospital’s director of security, said safety and training have been consistent priorities for security staff. However, security staffers, who also worked with hospital staff to ensure they were prepared, had not done extensive training since the end of the pandemic. Duval has also been named to a new state commission focused on hospital safety. \n\nA few events nationally led the team to “revisit our policy” and shift the focus from active shooter to armed intruder. \n\n“There have been situations, not only in the United States but across the world, where the killing of people in one incident happens in other ways other than firearms,” he said. \n\nDuval said security and medical staff needed to be focused on the person and the weapon, not just a gun. The security staff then rewrote many of the protocols over the course of about two years. During all of last year, employees at all three hospitals were trained with the new policies. \n\nEric Crane, a security program manager at the hospital, said employees worked on functional exercises, testing their eternal response to an event. Every department and employee was involved in hundreds of activities. The events and exercises were “short in duration” but meant to get employees to focus on what was happening at the hospital before outside personnel arrived to assist. \n\n“Our policy speaks to avoid, hide, and fight,” he said.\n\nPreviously, the policy was run, hide, and fight, but that often led to hundreds of employees all converging on exits, causing clusters of activity and chaos. By avoiding, employees create distance, and in many ways, Duval said, they are safer, too. \n\nCrane said he would act as an armed intruder and then instruct the staff to react to the scenario chosen for the training so the drill would be as realistic as possible. Hospital staff, he said, performed the tasks before work, during breaks and lunch hours, and after regular work hours, so their day-to-day activities focused on patient care were not affected by the training.\n\nSecurity officials conducted debriefings after the training to analyze each department's successes. Crane said each employee reacted differently to each scenario; some found their heart rates rising, while others had to address the emotionality of the training.\n\n“The reactions have been quite positive,” Crane said. \n\nDuval said each department now had safety and escape plans based on the training. And every employee, too, has their plans, he said.\n\n“We want them to keep this, not on the front burner,” he said. “Awareness. Don’t come to work afraid; come to work aware. And when you do that, you can do your job, reasonably safe, and the employee will be successful when they are mindful of their options.”\n\nAfter all the training, Duval and Crane raised the level beyond the hospitals to include outside law enforcement, fire and rescue teams, and other entities involved with emergency rooms. When there is conflict in a hospital, Duval said, it was often in an emergency department, even though it could happen anywhere in the building. But it was usually focused on a specific crisis incident.\n\nWhile law enforcement and firefighters will be involved, the focus will not be on their activities and reactions as much as on the reactions of the hospital staff and security.\n\nFranklin was held in May, and Laconia in August. After Wednesday’s work, the security officials will assess how everything went and then proceed.\n\nDuval and Crane said the hospitals had excellent working relationships with law enforcement partners around the county and were fortunate to have built rapport with the departments. \n\nThe drill will start at Concord Hospital around 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 25.\n\n"},

The county has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMontgomery County mailed out ballots on Sept. 17, the day after Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt finalized the ballots. But the county had not completed the necessary \"logic and accuracy\" testing of its machines, scanners, and ballot-marking devices, as required by state law, before the ballots were sent out, the RNC suit claims. \n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, joined the RNC in the suit.\n\n\"(Montgomery County) is the only county in Pennsylvania to have commenced voting without completing L&A testing,\" the suit states, adding that the county knew they had not completed the mandated safety checks. \n\nCounty officials said they did complete the necessary testing, and Montgomery County Commissioner and elections chief Neil Makhija said the suit is baseless. \n\n\"The RNC’s frivolous lawsuit is just the latest in a nationwide effort to engage in voter suppression, intimidate election officials, and undermine the democratic process,\" he said. \"Our Voter Services staff has been diligently and effectively working to make our elections accessible for every eligible voter. We will continue that work so that Montgomery County voters have a safe, secure, and accessible election.\"\n\nMontgomery County is the third most populous county in the state, so it's obviously pivotal to the final result of perhaps the most influential battleground state in 2024. The county has also been outspoken about efforts to improve their already high voter turnout. \n\nSuch legal gamesmanship has been part and parcel of the strategies of both Democrats and Republicans this election cycle. While Republicans attempting to disrupt elections over mail-in ballot-related legalese is nothing new, Democrats have similarly used the courts to their advantage, keeping presidential candidate Cornel West off the ballot in Pennsylvania. \n\nThe suit asks that Montgomery County be prevented from sending out any more ballots until that testing is completed. It also asks that the county be required to separately hand count the ballots that were sent out before the testing was completed. \n\n"},

According to the councilwoman:\n\n“Hopefully this will just help make things more consistent and transparent for the public,” Shin Andersen said.\n\nThe measure didn’t pass without some debate, however.\n\nAn amendment to the resolution excluded a phrase that members of the public are allowed to comment on any item which is “on the agenda or any governmental issue that they want to address.”\n\nCouncilor-at-large Carmel Loughman said the phrase might open the flood gates to contentious arguments and personal attacks that aren’t related to official town business.\n\n“We have had several times during our recent council meetings where people have come up and I believe they've used our public comment section as a means for them to air political stuff – let's just call it that,” Loughman said, arguing that they should be cut off if they're not discussing local governmental issues affecting Montclair.\n\n“We here are trying to do the business of the government,” Loughman said. “We cannot arbitrate people's opinions about this, that or the other, and I believe it's leading to kind of a lot of friction in the room and contentious discussions and personal attacks. And I really feel we need to limit what people say to just governmental things that [have] to do with the business of running Montclair.”\n\nThird Ward Councilor Rahum Williams then asked what would happen if a resident wants to speak about something “cheerful” that happened in their neighborhood or a community event.\n\nLoughman responded that the council is a “business organization” that is not responsible for “boosting Montclair,” adding that there are many local organizations that “do a great job of doing that.”\n\n“That's why we're having meetings that go seven hours long, because we spend too long on things that have nothing to do with running this government,” Loughman said.\n\nFourth Ward Councilor Aminah Toler disagreed.\n\n“I feel that the community should be able to come up here and have their say,” Toler countered. “They elected us here. We should be able to hear from them. Sometimes we don't want to hear everything they have to say. But where else will they have this opportunity? Yes, other civic organizations do wonderful jobs of sharing cheerful information, but I would recommend that we really think about this and ensure that any and every resident that wants to come forward and have a comment should be able to have a comment.”\n\n“Who are we to quiet people?” Toler questioned.\n\nMontclair interim town attorney Paul Burr said the state’s \n\n requires the council to permit a public comment session during its meeting, where the public can come and speak on any matter that they want to discuss.\n\n“So we couldn't limit it just to the agenda items,” Burr explained. “Now you can do it in two separate public comments – which is one of the reasons why the [previous] council decided to do that.”\n\nThe amended resolution reads:\n\nWatch footage from the Sept. 24 meeting below (video is cued to the discussion and vote).\n\n"},

Those who prefer winter made up about 3 percent of respondents.\n\nReaders told us they like the cool, crisp air of autumn and the spectacular displays of red, orange and yellow fall foliage, as well as seasonal foods and treats such as apple cider, soups and stews, and everything pumpkin or \n\n. Warm, fuzzy sweaters and other fall fashion got nods, too.\n\n“Autumn paints the world in hues of gold, orange and crimson. It’s a season of breathtaking beauty, where nature transforms into a masterpiece,” \n\n reader Teri said in her homage to autumn. “Trees, once lush with green, shed their leaves creating a kaleidoscope of colors that dance in the sunlight.\n\n“Crisp, cool air fills the atmosphere, invigorating the senses. The smell of fallen leaves and burning wood fills the air, adding a cozy and comforting touch. As the days grow shorter, the sun casts long, golden shadows, creating a sense of warmth and tranquility. It's a season of harvest, abundance, and the promise of renewal.”\n\n reader Susie likes fall for many of the same reasons. “The downside for the season is the darkness that comes early and daylight that comes later in the mornings,” Susie said.\n\n“The colors are vibrant and beautiful, the nights are cool and crisp while the days are still warm, and it’s the best time to make soups and stews and bake without overheating your house,” said \n\n reader Carla. “I feel so much comfort and happiness in the fall.”\n\n“I love the transition from summer green to the colors of fall, and the way the Earth says, ‘Now it’s time to rest and recoup’ from summer’s activity and movement,” said Jennifer, who lives in New Mexico. “Warm drinks, fall foods, warm clothing and the change to gathering inside our cozy homes with family really speaks to me.”\n\n“Apples. Apple cider, apple pie, apple dumplings, apple fritters, apple hard cider, apple crisp, apple cobbler,” said \n\n reader Demitraw “Coulda just stopped at apples.”\n\n“Cool, crisp, no- humidity days are finally here!” said \n\n reader Lisalu. “The deer come around in larger groups. Fat squirrel season is super fun to watch.”\n\n reader Dev also likes that cooler weather means “the bugs have gone back to hell, where they belong.”\n\n reader Kimeee says she’s a “sweater-wearing person” and looks forward to the fashion choices that come with the season. \n\n“Not to mention, you have Halloween,” Kimeee said. “There’s nothing that beats that season!”\n\n“It’s spooky season,” said \n\n reader Max.\n\n reader D. said fall brings cool, crisp relief after a hot, humid summer.\n\n“Fall is nature at its best work with the flowers still in late bloom and trees changing color,” D. said. “I love walking and crunching the leaves as the colors red, green, yellow and orange appear everywhere. The brown leaves crunch the best.”\n\nThe arrival of fall comes with a promise of fun yet to come — the beginning of school, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and then, “yes, maybe a beautiful snow storm,” D. said. \n\n“Early darkness is a sign it’s time to ‘hibernate’ and slow down (like a bear) after a busy, fun-filled summer,” D. said. “Fall is cozy, getting under blankets, wearing comfy robes and sweatshirts.”\n\nFor \n\n reader Lisa, there is no other answer.\n\n“Fall is the perfect season. The weather is warm during the day and cool at night, and driving around looking at fall foliage is a pleasure for many people,” she said.\n\n “The other seasons fall very short of, well, fall,” Lisa continued. “Winter is too cold and too long, and driving in the snow and ice can be dangerous. Spring is too rainy and too short, and driving in rainstorms can be hazardous. Summer is too hot and too sweaty, and driving with the sun in your eyes can be blinding.”\n\nLoosh, another \n\n reader, begs to differ. Fall is Loosh’s favorite, but winter is a close second.\n\n“Never cared for the hot weather, and the older I get, the less I can tolerate it,” Loosh said. “Chill and cold feel good, fresh and cozy. I enjoy wind and colorful leaves, trees without leaves, snow and longer nights. … Love these seasons, more so now, being retired. Don’t have to show up to work in snowy weather.”\n\nSurvey respondents’ second-favorite season was spring, a clear winner for Connecticut\n\n reader Ruby, who was a little Goldilocks and The Three Bears-ish in her answer.\n\n“Summer is too hot. The cold in winter doesn’t bother me, but I don’t like the snow, as I live along and have to shovel it. Fall is my worst season because everything begins to die, and my yard is full of leaves, which I have to hire someone to haul away,” Ruby said. “Spring is a new awakening of trees, flowers, etc. — definitely my favorite.”\n\nOther readers said that because spring follows winter is reason enough to give it most-favored season status.\n\n“After a cold, hard winter, spring arrives with warmth,” \n\n reader Linda said. “The birds return to sing their songs and the green of growing plants kisses the Earth. Flowers burst alive with color and fragrance. Daylight takes center stage until there are 12 hours of it! \n\n“What is not to love about spring?” Linda continued. “Summer is too hot in Pennsylvania, and while I do also love fall, it is the harbinger of winter, which I do not like.”\n\n“It offers endless hope,” said \n\n reader Steve.\n\n reader Elizabeth also sees hope in the longer, brighter days of spring after a cold winter. She drinks it all in — the change from light to dark green in the trees, the blooming flowers, the birds busily making nests to lay eggs, all of it.\n\n“Nature is magnificent,” she said\n\nSpring punches above its weight because it comes after winter in Rae’s book, too. \n\n“That in itself is enough for me, along with everything starting to bud and bloom and the birds returning to their feeders,” the \n\n reader said.\n\n reader Alice eagerly awaits spring blooms each year.\n\n“I love the fresh green leaves and the new blossoms on trees and flowering plants such as daffodils and, later, magnolias, dogwoods, cherry blossoms, and azaleas,” Alice said.\n\n reader Patty loves spring “because so much is being newly born, and reborn, and everything is just sprouting up, reminding you that life goes on — and it can be beautiful. And it’s OK.”\n\n reader Papa likes that “nature awakens for a new start” in the spring. “The landscape greens up and flower and tree blossoms abound,” Papa said. “The air warms and there is more sunshine.”\n\n“Watching the Earth come alive and critters become active” does it for \n\n reader Pamela, who previously lived in New Jersey.\n\nOctopi, a \n\n reader, only needed a couple of words:\n\n“It’s funner.”\n\n reader Terri thinks summer is the bomb diggity.\n\n“It’s so warm you don’t even have to wear clothes (unless you’re in public of course), but even then, you’re wearing fewer clothes than in any other season,” Terri said. “There is less laundry because there are no bulky winter clothes in the wash, the days are longer, you get better gas mileage with summer gas, there are no leaves to rake, no snow to shovel, and the summer sun boosts vitamin D levels. Summer has cool breezes and warm summer rains so you can go outside and play in the rain. \n\n“Summer has warm nights to be spent listening to peep frogs and crickets. People socialize more in the summer whereas they tend to ‘hunker down’ and isolate in the winter,” Terri continued. “There are festivals, county fairs, amusement parks, live outdoor music, dining alfresco, beach days, no school, days at the park, fireworks, picnics, biking, swimming, cook outs, camping this list goes on and on. … They don’t call it ‘summer fun’ for nothing!”\n\n reader Lisa is a fan, too.\n\n“I love the heat!” she said. “I love to be outside in the sun and at the beach, and hate being cold.”\n\n reader Trishy said she spends “every waking moment I can down the shore at our beautiful beaches.”\n\n“Summer makes me feel alive,” she said. “The days are longer, and depression goes away.”\n\nVernell, an \n\n reader, is an avid gardener and senior citizen who finds “great joy” in tending her flowers during the summer months, so different from the cold northern winters.\n\n“No matter what the day brings or how bad, I can always go outside and work in my yard, thereby relieving any and all stress that may come my way,” Vernell said. “I enjoy the colorful arrangements and take great pride in my accomplishments. I consider all my flowers as all my children. I love to plant things and watch them flourish.”\n\nThe only thing wrong with summer is that it doesn’t last long enough, according to \n\n reader Liz, who said:\n\n“I love the abundant sunlight and the warmth, even really hot and humid days. The days are longer and lighter, it feels like vacation most days especially when I can spend the day at the pool with my other retired friends! We swim and talk and enjoy the sun and each other’s company.”\n\n reader Josie said her favorite season, summer, gets some serious competition from fall because “the humidity leaves and the pumpkins appear,” and also spring, the season of renewal. Winter isn’t even in the running, “so why do I live in the Northeast?” Josie wonders.\n\n“Summer is most likely still my favorite season,” Josie said. “As a kid it meant no school or homework. I looked forward to going to day camp yearly. Fast-forward many years, and I felt the same way when raising my son. The days and nights were more carefree!”\n\n reader R.C. likes the smell of summer. \n\n“Love opening windows and summer rain smells,” R.C. said.\n\nMarilyn, who splits her time between Florida and Rhode Island, fondly remembers a poster from youth promoting the 1966 American surfing documentary, “The Endless Summer.”\n\n“I can still picture it,” Marilyn said. “I like being warm, and the ease of wearing shorts and tees. I like hearing the ocean, birds, coyotes and a little music playing softly in the background.\n\n“But,” she continued, “if and when those pesky mosquitoes come around in force, I can’t wait for the chill (and all things pumpkin) of fall!”\n\n reader Chris is likely to start crying when that happens because it means the approaching end to blooming plants.\n\n“I basically sob when the first frost kills them,” Chris said. “Everything looks like cooked collard greens after a hard frost.”\n\n reader Wolfgang’s take on hot, humid Florida summers is different from Marilyn’s. He suffered through them when he lived there, but since moving to Massachusetts in the late 1990s, he’s grown to appreciate summer.\n\n“Summer is my favorite season here because even though we may have a few days in a row of low 90s and high humidity it typically comes back to the low 80s and less humidity,” Wolfgang said. “It’s wonderful weather to do so many activities from beach to pickleball and with more hours of daylight there’s more time to enjoy.”\n\nWolfgang’s second-favorite season is fall because, he explained, “spring here is basically just winter’s wet, muddy cousin, except for a few weeks in May if we’re lucky.”\n\nNot everyone thinks of winter as the relative they allow only under protest to take up residence for three months.\n\nIt helps if people who live in Minnesota like winter. Some parts of the state received close to 100 inches of snow in the 2022-23 winter. Hardy Minnesotan Blair doesn’t mind a good workout clearing the snow from a long driveway and sidewalks.\n\n“I’m fortunate enough to live in a state that has four distinct seasons. They all have their merits, but I’m a real fan of winter,” Blair said. “When it snows, there’s nothing better than getting out with the kids on sleds, snowboards and skis. We love to ice skate, too. Winter is also my quiet time when I spend a lot of time enjoying the slower pace of things until scheduling hell breaks loose in the spring.\n\n“Winter should get more respect,” Blair concluded. “We need movement.”\n\n“Ahhh, the peaceful silence of winter,” said Ellen , another \n\n reader. “Leaf blowers, lawn mowers and loud motorcycles all come to an end. … Barking dogs are kept inside. At night the white glow of the land is nature’s nightlight and everything can be seen. Cozy blankets and no yard work. Snow removal isn’t daily like yard work. Stepping outside is a burst of feeling alive. Humidity of summer dragging one down is gone, and the cool fresh air wakens the body and mind. Snowfalls are magical.”\n\nThis says it all about winter for \n\n reader Petey: “Warm clothes, blankets, snow, soup.”\n\nAnd this sums up the season for \n\n reader Kay: “No pollen. Crisp weather. No sweating. More energy.”\n\n“Snow is so beautiful!” J., another \n\n reader, said. “Christmas lights are so pretty in the dark. I love cuddling under a blanket near a fire. I also love snow sports like skiing, sledding, and ice skating.” \n\n“I love the snow!” \n\n reader Bonnie said. “Being a teacher, I enjoyed hearing ‘snow day.’ Also, the clothes in the winter are more classy looking (boots, sweaters, leather and suedes).”\n\n“I just like cold weather,” \n\n reader Jody said.\n\n"},

Without this support, they will struggle to sustain themselves through hunting and scavenging.\"\n\nHowever, Caton Companies CEO Diane Caton told Holton that the company is \"in contact with Prince William County Animal Control, and any further efforts to address the cat population at Westgate will be coordinated through them.\"\n\nHolton urged Caton Companies to allow Purrty Pawz to relocate the cats if feeding on site is no longer an option. According to Holton, feral cats often remain in their territory rather than seeking new food sources, which presents a risk of malnourishment and illness. \n\nPurrty Pawz Rescue says Westgate Apartments is not the only site it works at. The rescue shared in a Facebook post that it feeds and traps cats every day and has cats awaiting spay/neuters and adoption.

PETE, FL — With minor flooding occurring as Hurricane Helene, a Category 3 storm, headed toward the Florida coastline Thursday, residents and business owners in the St. Pete area waited for the worst. The mayor said it's too late to evacuate, but many downtown bars and restaurants were busy and expecting more customers.\n\n at 548 Central Ave. is on the same electric grid as nearby Orlando Health Bayfront Hospital, bartender C.J. Tyson told Patch around noon.\n\n“So, I enjoy it,” he said. “We rarely run out of power. And we’re already known as a very big locals bar. You're safer here than most places.”\n\nMost of the businesses said they would close later in the day as the storm amped up.\n\nParts of the city are already seeing the effects of the massive storm system, which is barreling across the Gulf toward the Big Bend region. It’s expected to make landfall in that area sometime Thursday night.\n\nWhile heavy rains and tropical storm-force winds are expected in the Tampa Bay area, the storm surge is the most concerning part. About 5 to 8 feet of storm surge is expected along the region’s coast. \n\n“This will be a 12–36 hour water surge event … (and) an unprecedented amount of storm surge for St. Pete,” the city said in a news release.\n\nShore Acres and Snell Isle, areas that normally flood, are now closed to non-residents, the city said.\n\nSections of Bayshore Drive NE in St. Petersburg are already flooding, especially near the St. Petersburg Yacht Club, as water started to come over the seawall near the waterfront parks. Winds are also picking up, blowing debris around Central Avenue. \n\nDespite this, several bars and restaurants remained open, offering food, drinks, company and a safe haven for whomever needs it.\n\nTyson said of Bar@548, “If you circle back in an hour or two, this place will be packed.”\n\nMany locals don’t seem concerned about Helene, he added. “I came out (here) last night just to read the energy, to see how people were really worried about the storm. But nobody was really worried.” \n\nAs a Tallahassee native who has lived in locations throughout the Tampa Bay area for the past decade, Tyson’s biggest concerns are back home with his family.\n\n“They’re hunkering. They promised me they’re fine, but it’s still in the back of my mind about them,” he said. “When I did live there, we got hit really bad by Katrina and Ivan, and Katrina wasn’t a direct hit for us. Ivan was, and Ivan messed us up really bad.”\n\nIn the 200 block, known for its bars and nightlife, a busy bartender at \n\n, 247 Central Ave., told Patch around 11:30 a.m., “We're the only place open, so it's good for me, but I also want to get home.”\n\nShe moved on to take another order, as the bar and grill was crowded, about 35 people eating and drinking over the lunch hour.\n\nTwo blocks away, \n\n, 441 Central Ave. remained open, hoping for a busy lunch crowd, \n\n“It’s not too crazy right now,” Tyler Wagoner, manager, told Patch around noon. “We thought we’d just ride it out for lunch. Probably 3 o’clock we’ll get out of here. We’re just playing it by ear.”\n\nMeanwhile, in the nearby Edge District, \n\n, 1320 Central Ave., was serving food and drinks to at least 150 people around 1 p.m.\n\nRich, a bartender also known as “Coach” who has worked at Ferg’s since it opened 32 years ago, said the venue never closes during hurricanes.\n\n“We’re one of the few places that are open right now,” he told Patch. “We’ll go until about 5 o’clock and we’ll have a full house here. We have a generator and people are looking for something to do before it starts raining.”\n\nThough these bars and restaurants are bustling, it’s too late to evacuate, and residents should shelter in place, St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch said at an 11:30 a.m. news conference, \n\n reported.\n\n\"The storm conditions will only worsen over the next hours, the roads are becoming dangerous, and it's not safe to drive,\" Welch said. \"We have high-water vehicles ready, but we hope that we don't have to use them.\"\n\nAs the storm moves closer, conditions will become too dangerous for emergency responders to help, emergency manager Amber Boulding said.\n\n"},

{"title": "Nonprofit Aims To Build Bonds Between Across Generations In NoVA, DC", "description": "Through youth-led events and fundraising initiaves, Generation Union seeks to strengthen bonds between young people and older adults.", "link": "https://patch.com/virginia/mclean/non-profit-aims-build-bonds-between-young-old-people-dmv", "article": "MCLEAN, VA — Generation Union, a Presidential Volunteer Service Award certified nonprofit, has a mission of uniting young people and elderly folks across the greater Washington, D.C. area\n\n“Through youth volunteerism, we aim to uplift elderly mental health — an overlooked issue that has devastating consequences, such as elderly depression and suicidal thoughts,” said Areen Hashemi, the organization's co-executive director. The Herndon High School student founded Generation Union with Rachel Noh and Emily John, who are both students at McLean High School.\n\nGeneration Union hosts social events, such as its Mother’s Day Picnic, Bingo Night,and Pink and Red Hat Party. Through those events, the 501(c)(3) charitable organization's more than 250 youth volunteers form long-lasting bonds with the elderly.\n\nOutside of hosting events, Generation Union has led fundraising initiatives, such as the $3,000 it recently raised for \n\n, an organization that improves elderly healthcare.\n\nPatch asked Generation Union's three founders to share their thoughts about the importance of bringing young and elderly people together and what impact the nonprofit's efforts have had on both of those groups.\n\n: The New York Times covered a study of 23 intergenerational program studies from nine countries, and concluded that those initiatives reduced elderly depression and even improved elderly physical health as well. \n\nThat is Generation Union’s exact mission: bettering elderly mental health. Unfortunately, many elderly people in retirement communities experience loneliness and neglect. As a mental health advocate myself, I know the mental health advocacy space is growing, but elderly mental health is overlooked. What Generation Union hopes to accomplish through our social events is to show everyone — regardless of age, disabilities, etc. — that they are worthy; that they belong. \n\nA beautiful example of community-building and belonging that I witnessed was with a senior at Pacifica, Helen, who has hearing difficulties; whenever we played Bingo, she felt embarrassed that I had to repeat numbers or show her the Bingo card I called out. When Kirsten, our volunteer who is fluent in American Sign Language, learned about this, she started volunteering regularly and became Helen’s best friend. Kirsten signed the letters and numbers whenever we played Bingo so that Helen could play too! \n\nAlthough small and simple, our events act as a beacon of light for elderly folk and work to create an inclusive community where everyone feels loved.\n\n: To give a little bit of context, my inspiration for starting this type of volunteer work were personal experiences involving my grandparents’ diagnosis with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’S — both age-related and neurodegenerative disorders. By learning more about age-related disease, I was introduced to the world of senior care, and I would spend time on weekends volunteering at my local nursing homes or memory care centers.\n\nThrough conversing with the care managers and nurses there, I found an extremely prevalent but unfortunate issue for many senior citizens is lack of social connection. While senior living facilities do a great job of fostering community, a common issue is that families drop off their senior relatives, then are unable or unwilling to visit and spend time with them, causing a lot of elderly residing in these homes to feel isolated from the world. It has been proven that social isolation and loneliness cause or worsen serious health issues, like dementia, which have no cure.\n\nBecause of these cases, social connection can do a great deal. We find senior residents absolutely love spending time with our youth volunteers, and extremely value the friendships and connections they make. Intergenerational friendships are becoming increasingly less common, but they are so special in that they foster a unique exchange of experiences and perspectives, which Generation Union encourages completely.\n\n: My inspiration to start Generation Union came from my personal experience with my grandmother. My grandmother and I had a language barrier as she spoke Malayalam and I only spoke English so it was hard for us to communicate on our own, she also wasn’t very technology adept so we had trouble interacting with each other and staying in close contact. In addition the generational gap made it extremely difficult for us to relate to each other and my grandmother’s mental health suffered as a result. However, eventually we were able to connect through my teaching her how to use technology and the bonding experience we got from this really closed the generational gap between us and allowed us to form a meaningful connection. Growing close to my grandmother inspired me to do the same with others. This journey between my grandmother and I really taught me the importance of limiting generational gaps and connecting the youth and elderly.\n\n: At the recent Mother’s Day luncheon that Generation Union hosted, Hoop and I were blinking back tears as we were beyond overwhelmed by how grateful and happy the residents at Waltonwood were by our simple gesture. We had no idea how many mothers were unable to celebrate with their children and grandchildren. As immigrants, Hoop and I live about 7,000 kilometers away from our grandmas. Being able to spend mother’s day with grandmas who were also distant from their grandchildren was double heartwarming, as we related to their sense of longing; we were honored to make their special day a bit more special over food and heartwarming conversations.\n\nThrough volunteering, we see firsthand the impact us volunteers make, and the kindness we share is reciprocated. I believe that is the most invaluable and gratifying part of my work with Generation Union.\n\n One of the driving factors to starting Generation Union was to help solve that issue of social disconnectedness that elderly folk living in nursing homes often face. We offer senior residents a sense of companionship and friendship. Senior residents and their care managers comment a lot that they don’t really see a lot of younger people, and seeing how Generation Union is able to create those meaningful connections and joy between younger and older generations has been an honor to be a part of. \n\nIt has also been wonderful to see the progress that Generation Union has made over the years. At the start, we were a smaller group volunteering at local nursing homes in Northern Virginia. We’ve been able to expand our mission and impact through our presence in a number of high schools and a university around the world, which has been amazing to see.\n\n I find the bonds made along the way the most gratifying part about the work we do. For me personally, I met a really important friend and mentor along the way at our Easter arts and crafts event. I was able to make a personal bond with a woman named Diane and exchange life stories with her. I've had a plethora of volunteers tell me they have made meaningful bonds with various seniors along the way and it's great to learn about their lives and make a new friend along the journey. It is so fulfilling to see the seniors laugh and smile as they interact with volunteers and just seeing those bonds being actively made is so special.\n\n"},

He's now swimming to raise money for charity.", "link": "https://patch.com/connecticut/darien/swimming-cure-longtime-darien-resident-vows-keep-fighting", "article": "DARIEN, CT — Lying in the back of an ambulance clinging to life and unable to breathe, Ed Petner had a choice to make.\n\nIt was Aug. 23, 2003, and Petner, now 65 and a former longtime Darien resident, was on vacation with his family in Weekapaug, R.I. He went out for a 35-mile bicycle ride to Mystic, CT, and back, when, at about 17 miles into the trek, he was struck by a car while stopped at an intersection.\n\nAs he hurtled through the air resigned to the fact he was going to die, Petner thought of his four children, and he panicked that his youngest — ages 3 and 7 at the time — would grow up without a father. He heard a calming voice that said, \"Relax, everything's going to be OK.\"\n\n\"I interpreted that to mean you're going to die, but your kids are going to be fine,\" Petner told Patch last week.\n\nPetner accepted that he was approaching death. He had suffered fractures to his skull, neck, jaw, ribs, and vertebrae. His spinal cord was crushed, causing him to be paralyzed from about his ribcage down. His diaphragm stopped responding, and he was unable to inhale oxygen.\n\n\"I didn't see a light but I remember this inconceivable feeling of peace that came over me and a sense of awe as well, like the way you feel if you walk into a great basilica and you look up,\" Petner said of waking up in the ambulance. \"It was better than anything in this life. I could see my whole life behind me, and I had tremendous gratitude for every second of it. I was totally OK with that behind me now, and I'm done.\"\n\nA few minutes after he was hit, Petner woke up with first responders tending to him on the side of the road. He mustered up enough strength to give paramedics a phone number to reach his family. \n\n\"I didn't want to be a John Doe,\" Petner recalled, noting he didn't have any identification on him.\n\nWhile riding in the ambulance to the hospital, Petner woke up again, this time unable to breathe, and he heard one of the paramedics yelling at him.\n\n\"He said, 'Try and hold on just a little bit longer. Think of your kids,'\" Petner said. \"I remember being a little amused, because he thought I wanted to come back. I didn't want to.\"\n\nBut a memory of his wife, Peggy, in a Lamaze class from years earlier, popped into his head, and he began to breathe in air like he was sucking through a straw. \n\nAt that exact moment, the song \"Take It To The Limit\" by The Eagles began to play in the ambulance. It was Petner's personal fight song going back to when he was in high school on the track team, and it psyched him up through big exams in college and graduate school.\n\n\"It became clear to me that I had a choice,\" Petner said. \"That song of all songs, exactly at that second, came on and it gave me a little bit of faith. If I'm getting this message, there's no way it's by chance.\"\n\nPetner chose to fight, and he vowed to not let the accident define him.\n\nThe recovery and rehab process was long and challenging; Petner was given last rights four times in the first year or so after he was injured due to complications that cropped up.\n\nOnce he was released from the hospital, Petner used his pool to exercise. He was a good swimmer before the accident, but he figured he'd never be able to swim again. \n\nHowever, Petner adapted and developed the ability to function in the water, and by summer 2004, he was able to swim with his feet dragging behind him.\n\n\"Once I realized I could swim, I made a promise to myself that I wasn't going to let this accident keep me down,\" Petner said. \n\nFrom 2004 to 2022, Petner swam a mile on the anniversary of his accident in an act of defiance. \n\nTo mark the 20th anniversary last year and raise money for the Christopher Reeve Foundation to help find a cure for spinal cord injuries, Petner decided to swim a mile on 13 separate occasions. His initiative helped raise $30,000.\n\nThis summer, Petner upped the ante and set a goal of swimming 26 miles. He was slated to hit his mark on Sept. 25, which happens to be Reeve's birthday.\n\nThe goal is to make swimming for a cure each summer a nationwide effort, Petner said.\n\nReeve, of \"Superman\" fame, was paralyzed from the neck down following an equestrian accident in May 1995. Petner and Reeve had mutual friends, and the two spoke over the phone after Petner's accident.\n\nIn the years after his life changed, Petner, a former money manager and hedge fund operator, worked as a Sunday school teacher, substitute teacher, tutor and a basketball and soccer coach in Darien.\n\n\"It really gave me a lot of sense of purpose and meaning, and satisfaction of accomplishment,\" Petner said. \"The best part was getting to be dad again.\"\n\nPetner moved down to North Carolina in 2019, although he still has many friends and family still in Darien.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons Petner has learned over the last 20-plus years is how to have patience, and how to be willing to ask for help.\n\nHe also learned how to be happy, no matter the circumstances.\n\n\"Happiness is a decision. It has nothing to do with your circumstances. The only thing that really makes you happy is appreciating what you have. It's having an attitude of gratitude,\" Petner said. \"It's about appreciating all the little beautiful moments, and I've learned to do that. I'm a pretty happy guy.\"\n\n"},

DePauolo said.\n\n"},

She regularly performs her distinctive stand-up, complete with ukulele, at Gotham Comedy Club, The Broadway Comedy Club, Le Poisson Rouge, and many more. \n\nHer popular one woman show, \"I Married a Nun\" has landed her on the same stages as Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Gaffigan, and the late Joan Rivers. She also shared memories in her book, \"I Did It My Ways\", she said.\n\nForest, who grew up in the Boston suburbs, left the U.S. after a divorce and went to study abroad in Paris.\n\n\"After falling in love with the city, Forest would then embrace the French culture fully, which would determine the trajectory of the rest of her career,\" her bio said.\n\nOnce back in the United States, Forest performed as an international singer at golf clubs, country clubs, bars, and restaurants. However, her life as a singer was cut short when the entertainment business in New York City was brought to a halt after the 9/11 attacks. \n\n\"With no idea that she had the capability to be funny, Forest became what the world needed the most at that time — a comedian,\" her bio said.\n\nUkulele in hand, Forest put together a hysterical and risqué one-woman show which continues to draw crowds. She most recently performed her new show “D’yan Forest: 90 Years of Songs & Scandal” at Joe’s Pub.\n\nSpeaking with Patch, Forest described the experience of pivoting from singing to stand-up.\n\n\"I transitioned from singing to comedy because after 9/11, my singing and piano jobs were canceled. A lot of us musicians were out of business,\" she said. \"When I asked Caroline [Hirsch] of Caroline’s Comedy Club how to get into comedy, she got a coach to advise me on what I could do. I started making jokes about my age, and then put the singing into the comedy by doing parodies on my ukulele, singing and playing. It worked great, and I was accepted from the very beginning doing this innovative type of comedy.\"\n\nShe added that in her act today, she's able to incorporate all of her talents. \"I love doing the comedy because I love hearing people laugh with me, not at me. It’s been a great transition.\"\n\nComedy's changed over the course of her lifetime, Forest said.\n\n\"Now, comedy is, much of the time, done in the clubs where I work by very young people. Young fellows with mustaches and beards in their 20s, and young girls talking about their sex lives in their 20s. It seems to be getting younger and younger; therefore, I am quite an outlier because I’m 90 years old and talking about these things.\"\n\nBut her age doesn't stop Forest from forging ahead with her hilarious, and sometimes bawdy, brand of comedy.\n\n\"It feels great to be an old working comedian, because when I first walk into a club, people want to know which comic’s grandmother I am — and have no idea that I will be performing. When I get on stage, believe me, they are totally surprised by my schtick, and are totally entertained by this old lady. It gives me happiness that I can entertain all ages.\"\n\nFoster describes how she manages to maintain such a high level of stamina on and offstage.\n\n\"I take 12 pills every morning, and then I swim almost every day, and walk at least nine holes of the golf course during the summer. I have mostly younger friends who keep me having fun and keep me active. I don’t sit home and just watch television.\"\n\nThe entertainment landscape has changed dramatically since she first embarked upon her career, Forest said.\n\n\"The changes I’ve seen are that shows and movies are more explicit. Nothing’s barred. You can do anything and everything now in the entertainment business — and I do.\"\n\nOver the years, Forest said she's met many stars and famous people, both from doing comedy and being in films. \"What I find is that everybody is the same when you get down to the person-to-person level. Even though they’re famous, they’re just average people with hopes and dreams like me.\"\n\nWhen asked about the secret to living a long and happy life, Forest laughed. \"There is no secret, except I have never smoked or drank very much.

Parents and volunteers were angry, saying the person chosen was from the superintendent's former district and was placed on the agenda at the last minute.\n\nAt the meeting, board member Elizabeth Carr said she was resigning, citing a lack of trust, and left.\n\nOn Thursday, school board president Dr. Damali Robinson announced that the parents' pick, longtime coach Sara Wolman, has been offered and has accepted the position.\n\nRobinson wrote, in part:\n\n\"Dear Glen Rock Community Members,\n\n\"We, the members of the Glen Rock Board of Education, wish to acknowledge the concerns that were raised by parents, student-athletes, and community members at the September 23, 2024 Board of Education meeting. Given the feedback that the community raised, the Board has begun to take steps to address those concerns in order to ensure equity, consistency, and transparency for staff, students, and community members.\n\n\"Firstly, the Board would like to announce that Sara Wolman has been offered and accepted the position of Head Coach of the Girls Varsity Basketball Team.\n\n\"Additionally, as Dr. Brett Charleston mentioned in his recent letter to high school parents, the Board of Education authorized creating the position of a second Head Coach for Winter Track & Field. This decision results in two Head Coaches for the Winter Track program–one for the Boys team and one for the Girls team. The two existing assistant coaching positions will remain and will be shared by the teams as deemed necessary.\n\n\"While the Board recognizes that the District has room for growth–as all organizations do–we think it is important to acknowledge the recent accomplishments of our students and faculty. This past Monday, Hamilton Elementary was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, as the High School was in 2018. This is an honor regarded as one of the highest a school or district can achieve. Only nine public schools receive this honor in New Jersey each year, and we are proud that two of our schools have now earned this recognition.\n\n\"This past Monday, our Assistant Superintendent, Mr. Van Nest, and district supervisors presented scores from the spring 2024 NJSLA Assessment. As you can see from the presentation, our scores, particularly in math, continue to outperform the state average and have improved dramatically these past several years.\n\n\".... one of the Board’s goals this year is to begin the certification process with the New Jersey School Boards Association, aiming to achieve certification within the next two years. Board Certification recognizes the full board’s commitment to effective governance and continuous improvement through training ... The Board unanimously recognized the need to improve cohesion and working toward a common goal. Board\n\nmembers believe that achieving certification will strengthen our District and enhance relationships with stakeholders.\"\n\nThe petition about the coach hiring from Monday says, \"On September 23rd, 2024, the Glen Rock Board of Education approved a new Head Coach for the Glen Rock High School Girls Varsity position. This was done without any proper consideration for the current Junior Varsity Coach, Coach Sara Wolman. Coach Sara, a GRHS alum and former collegiate player, has been involved with the High School basketball program and has helped with the youth league programs for over a decade.\"\n\nThe petition adds, \"The other coach that was chosen for the job however has no experience living, playing, or attending a Glen Rock school. Initially, when the Varsity Head Coach position was vacated, the Athletic Director failed to contact Coach Sara about the opening...\"\n\nThe petition received \n\n by Wednesday afternoon. \n\nAt the meeting, students spoke in support of Wolman as well — as did her mother, a past board member.\n\nOne student said, to applause, \"We are a team of women and it would be empowering to be led by another, most especially Coach Sara.\"\n\nParent Stephanie Kivett Ohnegian complained that the superintendent has been hiring staff members from his past district, including the proposed varsity basketball coach.\n\nShe called Wolman \"One of the best coaches my daughters has ever had for both basketball and softball\" and rattled off a list of Pequannock staff members brought to Glen Rock, saying the superintendent (Brett Charleston, hired in 2019), had brought them in, to the detriment of the district.\n\nWatch the meeting \n\n, including comments starting at 1:01.\n\n"},

In addition to medication, the pharmacy also sells products such as anti-aging gel and 5-in-1 hair loss treatment foam. \n\n“It definitely took some time to start up,” Horowitz said. “Especially because it’s all online.

It wasn’t always so.", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/belleville/belleville-school-finances-are-good-place-official-says", "article": "BELLEVILLE, NJ — The financial picture is looking much rosier for the Belleville Public School District these days, administrators say.\n\nEarlier this week, district officials announced that Belleville got a certificate of excellence from the Association of School Business Officials for “diligent and accurate” reporting of its finances to the state in June. It’s the second consecutive year the district has received the award.\n\nIt’s a long way from where Belleville stood in 2014, when the district was operating at a deep deficit – which it dug itself out of with the help of a $4.2 million loan from the New Jersey Department of Education. As part of the deal, Belleville was assigned a state monitor – who still has a \n\n.\n\nOver the following years, Belleville began turning things around, bringing in two new administrators to help lead the effort: former superintendent Richard Tomko and business administrator Matthew Paladino.\n\nTomko recently departed from Belleville to take a new post as school superintendent in Garfield. However, Paladino still remains at the helm of the business office – and he says that the district is “in a good place now” thanks to a lot of hard work by a lot of people.\n\n“Under the leadership of interim superintendent of school Nick Perrapato, the board of education under president Gabrielle Bennett-Meany and our state monitor, Tom Egan, we’re already off to another great school year and we’re hoping to continue to build upon the fiscal discipline and strategic execution that we have established,” Paladino said.\n\nThe district is still facing challenges – among them, a steeply rising increase in student enrollment. \n\nBut according to Paladino and other administrators, the Belleville school district has seen some big turning points over the past decade. They include:\n\n “By 2017, the district showed marked improvement in the state’s Quality Single Accountability Continuum that measures a school districts’ instruction and programs, fiscal management, governance, operations and personnel. As of 2023, the district was earning an overall ‘high performing’ rating from the state, earning 100% success in three of the categories.”\n\n “Redistricting helped ease overcrowding in the middle school, and the Realizing Individual Student Enrichment (RISE) program has helped boost academics in a district that now boasts a 93% graduation rate.”\n\n “Pre-K education has also drastically expanded in the past six years in Belleville, and the addition of the Hornblower Early Education Center on Main Street has been home to more than 250 young students.” \n\n “In 2022, the district unveiled the Belleville Indoor Training Facility, a 25,000-square-foot space on Cortlandt Street housed in a converted auto body shop designed for high school athletes, as well as the public. The facility opened with two wrestling rooms, an all-purpose room with hardwood floors and a workout room with exercise equipment ranging from a golf driving simulator to chest presses to rowing machines. A year earlier, the ribbon was cut on a major renovation of Clearman Field, at Union Avenue and Holmes Street. The field services School No. 8, at 183 Union Ave., during the school day. Afterward, it is home to some of the school district’s sports programs, as well as open to the entire community based on availability. In 2017, Belleville voters approved a $48.5 million bond referendum that allowed the district to update the lighting, plumbing, HVAC equipment and more at several schools. The district was also able to use some of the funds to make its schools compliant with accessibility regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Of these and other capital projects, perhaps none has been more popular with students than the 2023 opening of the Buccaneer Bistro. The project transformed what had been the Belleville High School Senior Cafeteria into a new, welcoming space where fresh deli sandwiches, a pizza station, burrito bowls, Chinese food and other delights await hungry students.”\n\nProperty taxes in New Jersey are mainly made up of three parts: school, municipal and county. In 2023, the average Belleville homeowner paid $10,909 in property taxes on a home valued at $278,760. About 38.8 percent of that amount went to the school district. \n\nThe district’s state monitor approved a 6.42 percent tax hike for school taxes in Belleville earlier this year – which was a big jump from recent years. \n\nAlthough Belleville homeowners are facing a tax increase under the current budget, the district has set a goal of keeping tax hikes to $100 or less for the average homeowner during the majority of the past decade – a milepost that it has been hitting, according to \n\n.\n\nPrevious years’ increases in the Belleville school district include:\n\n"},

The district would be along 55th Street. \n\nThe village argues that without a tax district, the area in question would not see development.\n\nAt Thursday's school board meeting, Superintendent Lach questioned that assertion.\n\n\"We feel (the tax base) isn't lagging or declining in this area,\" he said. \"It seems like the value of the area is increasing faster than the village.

Right now, it's just the Village guessing on what the school board would accept based on public statements.\"\n\nCreer disagreed with the statements about the area in question. One of the state's factors is that the tax base in the proposed district lags behind inflation or village tax base growth for at least three of the last five years, Creer said. \n\nHe said the district has lagged behind the inflation rate. But he said he understands that many feel this metric is unfair because inflation was high. \n\nWith that argument, though, all new TIFs would be invalid during high inflation, Creer said.\n\nDuring Thursday's meeting, members said Clarendon Hills lacked a plan on how to invest the money. \n\nCreer said the village has presented ways it would spend the proceeds. \n\nOne of the focuses would be to redevelop the Tracy's Tavern property, he said. The bar, which closed years ago, was demolished last year \n\n. \n\nThe other possible investments, Creer said, would be fixing the intersection at 55th Street and Western Avenue, making pedestrian improvements like sidewalks and safe crossings, and improving water pressure. \n\n\"We only expect a few new developments, but it will be used to help retain and strengthen existing businesses,\" Creer said. \n\nOne of the village's biggest fears is losing the local Jewel store, which is in the proposed tax district. \n\nJewel is one of the two biggest sales tax producers in the village, representing over half the village's sales tax income, Creer said.\n\n\"Not having an insurance policy, given it’s the smallest and oldest store in the market, seems like a mistake,\" Creer said. \"Jewel closing would mean either tax hikes for homeowners or steep cuts to public services, likely public safety or road infrastructure.\"\n\nIn his email, Creer suggested the village may be sued over the tax district.\n\n\"Village’s biggest concern at this point is avoiding unnecessary litigation,\" he said. \"The only party to win from that would be the attorneys, and regardless, the taxpayers would lose.\"\n\nOver the last year, the school board has shown it's not shy about spending money on lawyers. Annual legal spending reached nearly $700,000, \n\n. The board is now looking at ways to curtail such expenditures. \n\n"},
{"title": "'History Changes': Salem Task Force To Tackle City Seal Debate", "description": "The task force will spend up to 18 months gathering information and preparing a recommendation on whether to change the official city seal.", "link": "https://patch.com/massachusetts/salem/history-changes-salem-task-force-tackle-city-seal-debate", "article": "SALEM, MA — The debate over whether the City of Salem's official seal — which has been in place since 1839 — should be changed based on its depiction of a Sumatran spice merchant as a symbol of the city's trade history will be under the direction of a task force approved by a split vote of the City Council on Thursday.\n\nThe 8-3 vote came after a divided public comment among those who view the seal as an important part of the city's history that should not be altered and those who say the use of a Southeast Asian merchant is exploitive and may promote a distorted viewpoint of that history from the Sumatran perspective.\n\n\"We have to take a deeper dive on this,\" City Councilor Andy Varela said. \"It would be uncouth and disrespectful not to have a larger conversation about our city seal. As we all know, history changes. And we need to be respectful and have these conversations. ...\n\n\"When it comes to the writing of history, there is a deeply engrained bias. ... Narratives have been shaped, been reshaped, to fit an agenda. We cannot say that it hasn't been. ... We cannot exclude that British and American authors consistently drew parallels between Southeast Asians and Native Americans identifying them as savages or less than (European-Americans). This is something, after looking at all the historical documents that came in (to the Government Services Committee), that we need to discuss.\"\n\nThe task force will include five residents and two historians, appointed through the mayor's office and confirmed through the City Council, and will have up to 18 months to gather information, solicit and listen to public testimony, and then make a recommendation to the City Council to maintain or change the seal.\n\nSince the seal was incorporated via a city ordinance, the Council would then have the final say on whatever steps would follow.\n\n\"I am confident that this task force will be able to do what we are looking for them to do,\" City Councilor Megan Stott said, \"which is (conduct) an open, community conversation around the city seal, which is blatantly obvious after the public comments tonight, that is needed.\"\n\nCity Councilor Cindy Jerzylo was among the Councilors who voted against the task force formation.\n\n\"Growing up in Salem I always viewed the city seal as honoring the Sumatran people for helping put Salem on the map,\" she said. \"I was saddened to recently hear that some find the city seal as a sign of racism. ... How can we now say that the city no longer wants to honor or recognize that history that continues to enrich our city today?\"\n\nAccording to Destination Salem, the seal was commissioned by the city to be designed by George Peabody in 1839. Peabody was a descendant of some of Salem's greatest pepper merchants and was himself a ship owner. Rather than depicting a scene of Salem, Peabody thought it fitting to draw a figure representative of a Sumatran merchant as a reference to where the pepper trade first began.\n\nSince 1839, the seal has been used on official city documents and records. In addition, using the seal on anything other than documents pertaining to official City of Salem business is a violation of state law and local ordinances.\n\nThose Councilors who supported the task force argued that voting against its formation would essentially end what is a necessary debate and that forming the task force itself does not mean changing the seal is a fait accompli.\n\n\"If there is a consensus among the working group, the task force, to change the city seal and there isn't a consensus among the residents of Salem, there is no way I am going to vote for that,\" City Councilor Patti Morsillo said. \"That is the point of the task force is for them to do the work, the research.\n\n\"There is still a pretty high bar for me to say that I am going to vote to change the city seal. It has to come back from the task force with not only reasons (it should be changed), not only a design but a consensus among the Salem residents to do so.\"\n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/newlenox/new-lenox-rare-disease-leads-fundraising-walk-mokena", "article": "NEW LENOX, IL — A New Lenox woman with a rare, progressive and debilitating neuromuscular disease is leading an effort to raise awareness of its impact. \n\nDoreen Pomykala suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, a hereditary condition that causes progressive nerve damage and muscle weakness in the extremities. Diagnosed as a child, Pomykala has endured its symptoms the entirety of her life, unable to walk without braces on her legs. \n\nUndaunted, on Sunday, Sept. 29 she will lace up her sneakers and head to Hickory Creek Preserve in Mokena, where she'll lead the Chicago Walk 4 CMT, an effort to bring together those with the disease, supporters, and community members. \n\nPomykala, 63, who taught New Lenox kindergarteners for years before she retired, has participated in the walk for 20 years, but this is her first year leading it. Her hope is to educate people on the disease. \n\n\"One of the biggest reason we’re holding this walk,\" she said, \"is because people don’t know what it is.\"\n\nPomykala, though, knows it all too well. \n\n\"I have had it my whole life,\" she said. \"I never could run or jump in school. I couldn’t run with my friends. As I got older, and it affected my hands, to write became difficult. I can’t button buttons, I don’t have the dexterity to do it ... opening jars, opening paperclips.\"\n\nShe was also a very late walker, she said. Pomykala inherited it from her mother, and carried a 50/50 chance of passing it on to her own offspring. One of her two daughters was diagnosed with it, as were two of her grandsons.\n\n\"In one of my grandsons, it’s quite debilitating,\" she said. \"He’s 4 years old, he’s in braces, he still has trouble walking.\"\n\nThe disease affects each person differently, she said, but typically starts in the feet and hands. It causes abnormalities in the nerves that supply a person's feet, legs, hands, and arms. It affects both motor and sensory nerves, according to \n\n. \n\n\"The nerves stop working correctly, the muscles deteriorate,\" she said. \"You can’t feel your feet or your hands. It usually affects your feet first, and then your hands. It moves up. It’s very different for every person. We’ve identified 100 different variations of CMT.\"\n\nCMT affects an estimated 1 in 2,500 people in the United States, and although considered a rare disease (under 200,000 people), experts believe the number to be much higher, r\n\n. There are an estimated 2.6 million people affected worldwide. CMT is considered to be one of the most common of the 7,000 rare diseases affecting children.\n\nThe Chicago Walk 4 CMT has led Pomykala to four individuals—not related to her—with CMT in the Lincoln-way area, she told Patch. \n\nIt's free to participate in the event. The walk starts at 10 a.m., with check-in opening at 9 a.m. at Hickory Creek Preserve, Hickory Creek Hollow Shelter, 10537 LaPorte Rd. Light refreshments will be served in the morning. A picnic and raffle will be held after the walk. Hot dogs, brats, chips, and water will be provided. Attendees are free to bring a dish to pass, or their own picnic lunch and drinks. Cornhole game and some kids' yard games will also be set up. \n\nThe walk ranges in length, from one quarter mile on flat, paved trail or up to several miles along the relatively hilly Hickory Creek Bikeway. Participants can walk, don't walk, or ride as far as they'd like. \n\nParticipants can \n\n as an individual, as part of a team, or form their own team. Pomykala's team is Team Doreen. Registration is free with the option to donate and/or fundraise. Those who donate or fundraise $100 or more will receive an official 2024 CMTA T-shirt. \n\nA donor will match contributions up to $200,000, Pomykala said. \n\n"},

She has gotten anonymous letters, including from the family of an 11-year-old who went to the walk and realized they needed mental health support. \n\nThe next \n\n is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 5 from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the Cascades Community Association, 47620 Saulty Dr, Sterling, VA. People of all fitness levels are encouraged to participate, and there will be a virtual option with a virtual opening remarks and keynote speaker for those who can't attend in person. \n\nLive4Lane, a foundation that has the 5K as its main fundraising event, promotes mental health awareness and resources. The name L.A.N.E. epitomizes the foundation's purpose: Learn. Awareness. Nurture. Education. Heil said one objective is to bring awareness and conversations about mental health to the forefront and get people help sooner. That includes families having open dialogue with their children to understand if their mental health isn't feeling normal. \n\n\"For us to normalize if our mental health is not normal, to speak up, don't wait for a crisis, because mental health can go through stages [like cancer],\" said Heil. \"There are ways to help, and if you wait, [there are] not as many options.\"\n\nOn the financial side, fundraising supports Mental Health Advocate Scholarships for Dominion High School graduating seniors. The recipients are recognized for working as advocates to raise awareness about mental health. To date, $22,500 in academic scholarships have been awarded to Dominion High School graduating seniors. \n\nBurrows would have graduated with the class of 2023. Reflecting on that, Heil said the focus of Live4Lane is shifting from simply honoring Lane to addressing gaps in mental health. As the scope of Live4Lane expands, Heil says the scholarship eligibility will later be expanded from Dominion High School to all of Loudoun County. The goal from this year's fundraiser is to provide $3,000 scholarships to two students. The goal of the 5K is $6,300, and the total amount raised will decide the scholarship amounts.\n\nSince the 5K began five years ago, it has grown from the Dominion High School community to the wider community. Heil encourages the community to come out to the event and be part of the conversation about mental health. \n\nThe community can learn about \n\n, \n\n, or watch the \n\n. \n\n\"I've had such a supportive community, and everyone comes together, and they really look forward to the event,\" said Heil. \n\n"},

The business is tucked away at the end of the industrial park along Amendodge Drive at Route 59, near the Interstate 55 entrance ramp.\n\nOn Friday, Shorewood filed a civil lawsuit at the Will County Courthouse against Onsite Truck & Trailer Repair. \n\nShorewood wants Will County's judges to order Onsite to stop using the two properties in violation of the village's zoning ordinances. The judges are being asked to fine Onsite $325, plus $10 per day that Onsite has operated a truck and trailer repair business at 304 Amendodge Drive. \n\nShorewood also wants a judgment declaring that Onsite cannot operate a trailer and truck repair business at either 301 or 304 Amendodge Drive.\n\n\"This case involves a company operating a truck and trailer repair business in violation of the village of Shorewood's zoning ordinances,\" the lawsuit states. \"Onsite has been operating a truck and trailer repair business out of two properties in Shorewood that are not suited for and not zoned to allow a truck and trailer repair business.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, 301 and 304 Amendodge Drive are both within Shorewood's general industrial zoning district, and the I-2 District \"is intended for intensive industrial activities. As such, automobile repair facilities are not permitted within the I-2 District.\"\n\nOnsite opened its truck and trailer repair business at 301 Amendodge on Nov. 16, 2018. \n\nThe business was granted a conditional-use permit by Shorewood on July 14, 2020 just to operate a trailer and truck repair business at 301 Amendodge Drive. \n\nThe conditional use permit was valid for one year, according to the lawsuit.\n\nShorewood pointed out that Onsite's website advertises 24 hour a day truck and trailer emergency repairs, 24-hour luxury RV and motorcoach repairs, round-the-clock heavy equipment repairs, as well as mobile and shop welding and fabricating and heavy-duty towing and winch-outs. In addition to that, Onsite provides mobile fueling and lock-out services and Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration inspections, as well as diesel emissions testing.\n\nAs part of the initial condition use permit that was granted, Shorewood imposed a number of stipulations on the business as part of the permit including the installation of a privacy fence along part of the property, staffing requirements and prohibiting the storage of junk and regulating the use of vehicle parts being stored there.\n\nProblems for Onsite with Shorewood village officials developed after the business expanded its operations, \"sometime prior to March 9, 2021 ... and began running its truck and trailer repair business at 304 Amendodge Drive. Onsite has never obtained a business license or a conditional use permit for 304 Amendodge Drive,\" the lawsuit explained.\n\nOnsite's conditional use permit expired in Shorewood on April 26, 2022, and \"Onsite violated many of the conditions set forth in the ordinance ... Onsite employees parked trucks and trailers in the front of the property and along the street in violation of the parking restrictions; and stored vehicle parts, pallets and garbage in prohibited areas,\" the court case reflects. \"The village received complaints from neighboring residents and business owners regarding Onsite's use of the property.\"\n\nOn March 12, Shorewood's Village Board declined to approve any conditional use permits for 301 and 304 Amendodge, the lawsuit noted. \n\n\"Onsite continues to operate its truck and trailer repair business out of 301 and 304 Amendodge,\" the village's lawyers outlined at the courthouse.\n\nOn Sept. 9, Shorewood Director of Economic Development Natalie Engel inspected both properties and \"she observed a sign with the inscription ONSITE hanging from the building at 304 Amendodge,\" the lawsuit noted.\n\n"},

Donations to NAWS of Mokena, PAWS of Tinley Park encouraged for admission. ", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/newlenox/new-lenox-familys-over-top-haunted-trail-set-weekend-scares", "article": "NEW LENOX, IL — A New Lenox family's tradition returns Sept. 28, promising big scares and screams, to benefit two good causes. \n\nThe Malpeli family's Haunted Trail, set for Sept. 28–29 and now in its fourth year open to the public, features 10 different areas and roughly 60 \"scarers\" scattered around the roughly half-mile experience. Designed by Brian Malpeli and with the help of volunteers set to scare those traipsing along the trail, Malpeli said this year is quite possibly his best yet. \n\n\"As over the top as ever,\" Malpeli told Patch, laughing. \n\nThe trail is situated in woods—the ground can be uneven, with slight dips and downhill spots—and the perfect setting for a good jump scare—or two, or three, or—well, let's just say, more than a few. Malpeli doesn't want to spoil the fun by hinting at the scares along the way, but there's chasing. And chainsaws. And tunnels. And—well, you'll have to wait and see. \n\n\"You’re going to be really scared going through it,\" Malpeli assured. \n\nThe haunted trail had its start in 2017, when Brian and Mary Malpeli's kids were younger and the family had just moved to New Lenox. It's grown in scope and audience in the years since—Brian's vision executed with the help of friends, neighbors, and other willing contributors. \n\n \"It started as a novelty for my kids and my friends,\" Malpeli said. \"I wish I could tell you I did things small. ... I’m not a Halloween head, I just like to entertain.\"\n\nMalpeli looks forward to seeing people explore his creation, especially as he embellishes it each year. The woods are the ideal backdrop for his big dream, and people seem thrilled after they've walked through. Last year's haunted trail saw roughly 1,000 visitors over two days. \n\n\"The life in the woods is so much more spectacular at this time of the year,\" he said. \n\n\"They’re overly surprised by what they are in store for. This is intense. I do not mess around. It’s a lot more jump-scare than it is theatrical.\"\n\nFor admission, Malpeli encourages donations and each year selects a local charity as the recipient. Past charities have been CASA of River Valley, a volunteer organization that advocates for the best interests of children in abuse and neglect cases within the Will County court system, as well as Cal's Angels, a group that supports kids fighting cancer through wishes, awareness, and research. \n\nThis year, Malpeli and his wife turned their focus to supporting animal rescue organizations NAWS of Mokena and PAWS of Tinley Park. Both animal shelters offer a variety of services and programs, and will have representatives onsite, possibly including some of their adoptable animals, Malpeli said. There is no required donation amount; a donation of $5 is suggested. They will also accept donations of clumping litter, Purina One dry cat or kitten food, Purina One dry puppy or dog food, paper towels, wet cat/kitten food, wet dog food, hand sanitizer, and bleach. \n\nThe Malpeli family will match total donations up to $5,000, but their matching amount will be donated to Make-A-Wish, a cause close to their hearts. \n\nIt's important to note that the trail is not handicap accessible, and is only for those that are able to walk without assistance—no wheelchairs, scooters, crutches, or strollers. Please leave pets at home—they will not be allowed on the property. The line starts forming at 6:30 p.m., and gates open at 7 p.m. The trail walks start about 7:15 p.m., or once it's dark enough, the organizers said. The trail takes approximately 20-25 minutes to experience, Malpeli said. They will stop accepting people into the line at 8:45 p.m. Malpeli also asks that all visiting be respectful of the neighbors when parking and driving on local streets.\n\nMalpeli and his wife encourage parents to use their discretion when deciding if they should bring their children.\n\n\"The woods are dark, and there’s scarers out there!\" they said.\n\nIn addition to supporting community causes, the trail incorporates the help of local teens volunteering as the \"scare staff\" in return for service hours, Malpeli said. They're in it for the causes, too, Malpeli said, as he makes sure to explain why each recipient needs the boost. \n\nAnd oh, of course they're there for the thrill of the scare. \n\n\"It starts the moment you get on my property,\" Malpeli said, laughing. \"... Actually, the scares start before you even get here.\"\n\nThe trail—currently set for just Sept. 28–29—is located at 249 Canterbury Ct. Parking is available at Haines Elementary and Oster Oakview schools. \n\n\"It gets more fun every year,\" Malpeli said, of putting on the big show. \"It’s really not about recognition for me, it’s about people having fun.\n\n\"We really do it cool. ... We take it pretty seriously.\"\n\n"},

But if you head further off the main freeways, a world of hidden-gem zoos and unique animal parks await.\n\nAmong them are one of the nation's only two alpine zoos, a haven for wild cats and a tiny zoo that's the state's oldest. Check out more information about those zoos, along with three others, below:\n\nEureka\n\nSome of the tallest trees on earth surround the Sequoia Park Zoo, which dubs itself one of the smallest accredited zoos in the U.S., as well as the state's oldest. The zoo punches above its small stature, serving as the home to over 150 animals representing more than 50 species. And its signature attraction, the Redwood Sky Walk, offers something else even the largest of zoos can't — the quarter-mile jaunt, 100 feet above the ground among sequoias, is the longest sky-walk in the West.\n\nPalm Desert\n\nWhile it can appear cruel and \"dead\" at first blush, the Colorado Desert (south of the Mojave) — like so many arid landscapes — is actually bursting with activity from the plants and animals that live there. Located just outside Palm Springs, the Living Desert illustrates the diversity of the world's desert ecosystems with exhibits featuring the flora and fauna from Africa, the Americas and Australia. Unique experiences include a chance to come face-to-face with rhinos, feed giraffes and embark on a private safari tour.\n\nBig Bear Lake\n\nLocated over 7,100 feet above sea level in the San Bernardino Mountains, this zoo holds the distinction of being just one of two alpine zoos in the country. The zoo specializes in animals that can be found in the Big Bear Valley — like bears and mountain lions — as well as other species that respond well to the mountainous environment, like grizzly bears and wolves. Though grizzly bears are long gone from California, they once dominated the Big Bear Valley, giving the region its name. \n\nBakersfield\n\nYou won't find any cheetahs or elephants here. While many zoos wow visitors with animals that come from far-flung locales, the California Living Museum's mission is to educate the public about the extraordinary diversity of animals and plants that exist within the Golden State. Exhibits include bighorn sheep, cats of California, Reptile House and California Coast Room.\n\nSanta Rosa\n\nSafari West's mission of bringing the wilds of Africa to California goes beyond letting visitors wander through its preserve on guided safaris. After the sun sets, guests are invited to spend the night among its 900 animals in a luxuriously appointed tent. Other special attractions reflect Sonoma culture, like private wine-tasting safaris.\n\nDunlap\n\nNestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, this Central Valley facility is all about cats. As part of a mission of conservation and education around felines, the Cat Haven's 93-acre grounds include familiar faces like leopards and cheetahs, as well as more unusual cats like caracals and jaguarundis.\n\n"},

The next one will mark the last weekend of Suicide Prevention Awareness month. Riverside residents can participate in the Out of Darkness Walk on at 9 a.m. Saturday in Fairmount Park, which is located at 2601 Fairmount Blvd. The walk will offer opportunities for residents to connect, share stories and honor those lost to suicide. \n\nAnd annually for the past three years, the coalition has hosted a Suicide Prevention Coalition Conference, where law enforcement, educators, healthcare workers, first responders and those working at youth-serving agencies can listen to keynote speakers, panel discussions, trainings and more. The event is also open to the public. \n\nAntillon said that this year's conference is already at capacity, but those interested can still livestream the event at 9 a.m. on Thursday; just visit \n\n. \n\nTo keep suicide rates on their downward trend countywide, Antillon encourages residents to educate themselves on local resources.\n\n\"Many who are experiencing thoughts of suicide may feel scared or ashamed to tell someone,\" she said. \"The best thing we can do is educate our selves and really encourage everyone to learn to recognize the signs of suicide. Then, more importantly, how to ask direct questions and connect the person to the additional resources and support that can help them further.\" \n\nThat's why the county is offering free suicide prevention training to anyone who is interested. Find more information about that \n\n. \n\nRiverside County also has a local helpline for anyone in crisis or those struggling with suicide ideation. The number is 951-686-HELP (4357). \n\nAntillon says the local helpline has trained workers can help deescalate a crisis. What's more, they have access to 211, a resource and referral line, allowing crisis workers to look through a database to offer additional resources on that call. If the person is actively contemplating suicide and immediate support is needed, workers can connect them to a mobile crisis team that can go talk to them in person. \n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is also available at 800-273-8255 or 988.\n\nAcross Riverside County, there are also three mental health urgent care centers that are available 24/7.\n\n\"They will see people regaurdless of their insurance,\" she said. \n\nTwo of the centers also offer support to those 13 and older. Find locations \n\n. \n\nAt the end of the day Antillon emphasized that lowering suicide rates really comes down to strengthening support systems and finding community. \n\nDuring the month of September, Antillon says the county has supported the state's awareness campaign \"Love Over Loneliness.\"\n\n\"We know that one of the best protective factors that we can put in place is a strong support system and that's a support system that can offer us comfort, security and even connection,\" she said. \"And that doesn't have to be just what we consider traditional family.

The woman told an officer he left the home and walked toward Coral Street. \n\nThe dispatcher told the officer that Bosco had an active stalking warrant. \n\nAfter taking the report, the officer canvassed the area and found Bosco in the area of Washington and Charles streets, an affidavit said.

Such was not the case, however, with John Ashton.\n\nAshton, a 1966 graduate of Enfield High School who went on to big screen stardom in the \"Beverly Hills Cop\" movie series, died Thursday at his home in Fort Collins, Colorado after a brief illness. He was 76.\n\nHe played Sgt. John Taggart alongside stars Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold in the first two BHC films, released in 1984 and 1987, respectively. He did not appear in the third installment, released in 1994, but returned to the fold nearly three decades later in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, which debuted on Netflix in July 2024.\n\nDespite his tremendous success and living in a different part of the country for his entire adult life, Ashton always maintained a strong connection to his hometown. Last fall, his brother Ed was inducted into the Enfield Athletic Hall of Fame as a member of the 1961 Suburban League football championship team, and Ashton was present at the Hall of Fame dinner at the Oak Ridge Country Club.\n\nThe next day, he and some old friends got together to share stories about their time growing up in Enfield. For the occasion, Ashton wore a shirt which read, \"Enfield Connecticut, It's Where My Story Begins.\"\n\nIt began on Francis Avenue off Route 5, where former neighbor Paul Zenczak recalled, \"Played hide and seek and baseball with him on Francis Avenue in Enfield when I was a kid. Great guy. \"\n\nHe became a proficient athlete, playing on a Thompsonville Little League All-Star team which made it to the state semifinals. Upon entering Enfield High School, he played football on both the offensive and defensive lines, and was also a member of an early Raider ice hockey squad.\n\nFormer neighbor and teammate Charlie Ragno told Patch, \"Nobody could say a bad word about John Ashton. He was a great teammate and a great friend.\"\n\nDonna McCue said, \"He was a good friend, he hung around at the pop store with us on Alden Avenue.\"\n\n\"I remember John as a classmate with a witty personality, who always had a smile for everyone,\" fellow 1966 grad George Van Tasel said.. \n\nAshton developed his thespian skills while in high school, spending two years in the dramatics club and being voted Class Actor as a senior.\n\nUpon leaving Enfield, he spent some time at Defiance College in Ohio before heading further west, graduating from the University of Southern California School of Theatre.\n\nLike most young actors, good roles were hard to come by, and Ashton found himself taking small parts in forgettable films such as \"The Psychopath,\" \"So Evil, My Sister,\" \"Borderline\" and \"Honky Tonk Freeway.\" He also made a slew of one-off appearances in popular TV series like \"Kojak,\" \"Emergency!,\" \"Columbo,\" \"Barnaby Jones,\" \"Police Woman,\" \"M*A*S*H\" and \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nIn 1978, he landed his first recurring role in a hit series, appearing as Willie Joe Garr in six episodes of \"Dallas.\" On the big screen, he had a featured role in 1984's \"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,\" which was financially unsuccessful at the time but has since become a cult classic. His next opportunity was \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" and the rest is history.\n\nOver the past four decades, Ashton had starring roles in films like \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" \"Midnight Run,\" \"Curly Sue\" and \"Little Big League.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements have not yet been completed.\n\n"},

So it came as no surprise when she followed her dream to become a pediatric occupational therapist(OT) and open her own practice called \n\n.\n\n\"I was introduced to occupational therapy because I have a family member who's also an OT and it really, it felt like a calling,\" said Davison to Patch.\n\nWhen Davison was in high school, she babysat for an autistic child where she got to see some of the child's therapy sessions.\n\n\"It was so amazing to kind of see how she lit up when therapy was going on, and it was a source of so much joy for her. But she was also working really hard, so it was really, really exciting to see as a high schooler,\" said Davison.\n\nThis fueled her passion for helping children to fulfill independent and meaningful lives. Davison graduated with honors from New York University with a Masters of Science in Occupational Therapy. She is a board-certified and registered occupational therapist.\n\nAfter completing her clinical rotations at NYU Langone (Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital), Mount Sinai Beth Israel, and Bellevue, Davison opened Glow OT, a mobile pediatric occupational therapy practice serving the Somerset, Union and Morris County area.\n\nDavison specializes in working with neurodivergent children ages 2-14 with autism, ADHD, anxiety, feeding differences, etc.\n\n\"I'm passionate about using strengths, connections, relationships, and play in therapy sessions,\" said Davison.\n\nHer specialty areas include sensory processing, emotion regulation, behavior support using neurodiversity-affirming practices, and feeding therapy.\n\n\"There's something called pathological demand avoidance(PDA) and sensory processing disorders. What is at the center of my practice is kind of connections and relationships, and using those connections and relationships to regulate and build confidence. And that's really where my name came from,\" said Davison.\n\nThe biggest feedback Davison gets from parents is that their child is so confident in the park now or the playground, and they're able to kind of tackle challenges that they weren't able to tackle before. \n\nDavison said that having the confidence to approach something in life translates to adults as well, if we don't have the confidence to do so, or we perceive it to be challenging it can become a barrier to engagement and participation.\n\nThat's where Davison comes in to build that confidence in a child so they know they can accomplish hard tasks with their parents and Davison's support.\n\nOverall, Davison says she is very passionate about her profession and watching the children grow and \"glow\" is very rewarding.\n\nFor example, Davison has been working with an autistic child who was having a lot of trouble with transitions, specifically to go outside his house.\n\n\"The other day, we were really engaged in a play activity using some trains. And we actually took a ride on the trains out to his deck patio area, and then from there, he was having so much fun that we brought the trains down onto the grass and then onto the play thing. And it was just a really beautiful moment, because, you know, being outside, the transition part, kind of took a back seat,\" said Davison. \"He really kind of was just so engrossed in the play activity that he didn't even realize we were outside. And once, he looked up from that play activity and came back to what we were doing. He was like, 'Oh, we're outside, and it's not that bad.' And it was a really beautiful moment to kind of see that realization of, 'Oh, I can do hard things and it's okay'.\"\n\nThose wins seem small to others but are monumental to the child and Davison loves being apart of those scenarios.\n\n\"The foundation of my practice is really just about that connection-and-relationship-based approach and using play,\" said Davison. \"When I spend so much time building that therapeutic relationship and trust. There's no need to use external reward based systems, because a child has that intrinsic motivation to want to engage and participate when there's connections and relationships.\"\n\nAs a passionate OT, Davison welcomes new clients with a consultation or assessment to customize and discuss the child's needs.\n\nFor more information visit \n\n or email \n\n or follow \n\n.\n\n"},

We’re hoping to rally our local community to get behind this remarkable teacher.\"\n\nIn her entry, Brazel spoke \n\n. In her 19th yearin education, Brazel has worked within Bremen District 228 for nine years, having first started at Oak Forest High School. She shifted to Tinley Park High School four years ago. \n\n\"... I am passionate about making sure every student feels seen, heard and recognized for their efforts both in and out of the classroom,\" she wrote. \"I celebrate even the smallest wins and build connections with both my students and their families. Being able to build those long-lasting relationships is what makes this job amazing. We hope students will retain the information that we have taught them, but we know that they will always remember how they were treated.\"\n\nThe public will cast online votes for their select finalist of the top 10. Voting is open now through Oct. 11, and each unique email vote helps move Brazel one step closer to winning. \n\n\"Winning the 10k would be an amazing contribution for both our school and my family,\" Brazel wrote. \"We have so many students that would be able to benefit from this money. We could use the money to acquire additional supplies that will help our students grow academically and also save some to have a little bit of fun with. Our students would be incredibly appreciative and deserve everything that comes their way.\"\n\nOn a personal level, Brazel said she would use the money for much-needed financial support for her family, in the midst of medical stressors. \n\nBrazel and husband Ryan have three children: 8-year-old twins Frankie and Charlie, and 10-year-old daughter Molly. Frankie was born with the effects of twin-twin transfusion syndrome. The syndrome is a rare pregnancy condition affecting identical twins or other multiples, and occurs in pregnancies where twins share one placenta, and a network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients essential for development in the womb, \n\n. One twin — known as the donor twin\n\n— gives away more blood than it receives in return and runs the risk of malnourishment and organ failure. The recipient twin receives too much blood and is susceptible to overwork of the heart and other cardiac complications. \n\nThe twins were born two months early, Brazel said. Frankie was diagnosed as the donor twin. His most significant diagnosis is that of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Three years ago, Brazel and her husband placed him on palliative care. They are currently building an addition to their home, to create a space for Frankie that will simplify his movement throughout the home, and allow easier access to provide him care. \n\n\"We fight very hard for him,\" Brazel said. \"We fight for all of our kids, but he’s really changed the trajectory of our lives and how we choose to live them. It definitely makes you look at things a little bit differently.\"\n\nDoctors have said there's no exact prognosis or lifespan for Frankie. It could range from a year, to 10 years, Brazel said. \n\n\"There's no rhyme or reason,\" she said. \n\n\"Since we put him on end of life care, he’s being doing phenomenally. It’s a day-by-day thing.\"\n\nFrankie is her inspiration behind her work. \n\n\"Frankie is the reason I come to school each day, and why I have such a positive outlook,\" she said. \"My husband and I are the sole providers for Frankie's care, and this money will assist with creating a comfortable room for him in his final years. Currently, we each work two jobs on separate schedules to provide these extras for Frankie. This money will allow us to spend some additional time together as a family.\"\n\nMaking it this far in the contest means so much to her. \n\n\"My principal nominated me, and I was very unaware,\" Brazel said of Principal Theresa Nolan. \"We have unbelievable administration here who support us, that’s the best for me. You’ve got an awesome support system here.\"\n\nWhile hopeful for a win, she's grateful to be appreciated. \n\n\"While winning the money would be amazing, the recognition for what we do in the classroom is what means the most,\" she said. \"This is an incredible win-win opportunity for our Titan Family and my own family. It is truly a humbling experience.\"\n\n"},

Patch.com is posting candidate profiles for local and statewide races in the coming weeks. Here is the profile for Jamie Mosser, candidate for Kane County State's Attorney.\n\nYour Name: Jamie Mosser\n\nTown of Residence: St. Charles\n\nPosition Sought: Kane County State's Attorney\n\nParty Affiliation: Democrat\n\nFamily: Three children: Parker (15), Camile 13, and Vivian (10)\n\nEducation: Bachelors of Science from Illinois State University - Major Political Science, Juris Doctor from DePaul University with a Certificate in Criminal Law\n\nOccupation: Kane County State's Attorney - 4 years, private attorney - 4 years, legal aid attorney - 2 years, Kane County Assistant State's Attorney - 10 years, New Orleans Assistant District Attorney - 2 years.\n\nPrevious or current elected or appointed office: Elected Kane County State's Attorney in 2020.\n\nCampaign website: \n\nThe single most pressing issue facing our county is domestic violence. The The majority of the cases that come through our system are domestic violence related. Due to the cycle of violence, children that grow up in DV homes are statistically more likely to be an abuser (boys) or a victim (girls)and may suffer from significant physical and mental health issues along with addiction issues. In speaking with most inmates in jails or prisons, the vast majority of offenders have experienced some form of DV in their lives. I have been working with our judicial system to transform three of our courtrooms to focus on DV crimes so that the Judges, prosecutors and public defenders are specialized in those matters. They would be trained to be victim centered and trauma informed. We will bring in programming that is able to help the victims and offenders to break the cycle of violence along with providing therapy for the children that witness DV. This approach will lessen recidivism while providing true protection to victims. \n\nMy opponent spouts that he will take the 'law and order' approach to criminal behavior without explaining what that actually means. Each defendant that comes through the criminal justice system needs to have the case looked at individually to see what true justice should be. Not every person needs to go to jail or prison to be held accountable. Our criminal justice system can have a valuable impact on our community if we prosecute ethically always looking for what is right for the defendant, the victim, and our community. Kane County needs a prosecutor that will not take a one sided approach to prosecution. Further, my opponent has not proposed any programming or initiatives that he will put in if elected. As the State's Attorney, I have proven I can find the resources needed to keep this community safe. \n\nAs the current State's Attorney, I have provided a balanced approach to prosecution. Those who can be reformed are provided the opportunity to take accountability and get access to treatment and resources. With that being said, there are individuals who choose to make our community unsafe and they need to be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. While in office, in conjunction with the Sheriff's Office, I created Kane County's Child Exploitation Unit that investigates and prosecutes those who possess, create or disseminate child pornography cases. This unit alone has tripled the amount of cases that were being investigated and prosecuted prior to my administration. Additionally, we have applied for funding to create a Human Trafficking Unit. This unit will employ investigators, prosecutors, advocates, and translators to investigate and prosecute Human Trafficking cases in Kane County. Because this is such a specialized area of law, you need investigators, prosecutors and advocates that understand the complexities in these cases along with helping to get the victims the help that they need. \n\nThe innovation that I have brought to the office already has been a great accomplishment for Kane County including expanding deferred prosecution, creating pre-arrest diversion, and our creating our 4th specialty court. The creation of the Child Exploitation Unit has been a huge accomplishment for keeping our children safe from child predators. In my second term, I will continue to bring programs that help those in need while watching crime trends to see where we need a directed approach. As mentioned earlier, we are seeing a rise in Human Trafficking cases likely due to the migration issues Illinois has suffered from. The creation of a Human Trafficking Unit will help to protect those being victimized in our community. Additionally, having a greater focus on breaking the cycle of violence for Domestic Violence cases will reduce recidivism rates and protect those from being victimized as I explained in another question. \n\nI ran for office originally wanting to bring true criminal justice reform to Kane County. In my first term, I have been able to accomplish that and more. I expanded the programming that we have to help low level/low need offenders with robust deferred prosecution programs. I created Illinois' only pre-arrest diversion program that is designed to partner with police officers to help those who are committing crimes due to untreated mental health issues, substance use disorder, or a lack of resources. I also helped to create our 4th specialty court program that helps high risk/high need offenders who commit multiple DUI offenses. These programs have been proven to help get people to treatment and resources while still holding them accountable for their criminal activity. When re-elected, I will continue to bring innovative programming like this to Kane County. \n\nThe most important thing to ask elected officials is how they are spending governmental funds. As an elected official, it is my duty to prosecute cases fairly and to represent the County in all civil matters. I employ 196 people ranging from support staff to investigators to advocates to assistant state's attorneys. Through my first term, I have provided transparency in each of the divisions within my office. We have also disseminated the statistics related to each division in our end of year reports that can be found on the Kane County State's Attorney's website. We, as elected officials, need to be transparent in how government funds are spent and are in line with our mandated duties. As the State's Attorney, it is my job to always focus on public safety and how best to defend our County and their elected officials. I have done that with fiscal responsibility at all times. \n\nAll elected officials should be good stewards of funding and be transparent to the community. As the elected State's Attorney, I have been under budget each year in office. I have provided presentations through our Judicial and Public Safety Committee as to how we have spent county funds. Further, when new positions were needed, I requested that funding through the County Board by providing statistical data and the concurrent need. Unfortunately, I was also subjected to unfunded mandates through the passage of the Safe-T Act. I worked with my judicial partners to analyze what new positions were essential to implement this law in the most effective way. While my budget has increased due to this over the last four years, it was done with County Board approval and with the data to prove that all increases were necessary. Additionally, I do not rely solely on the County Budget. I also seek other funding through local, state and federal grants. I have been able to supplement my budget with these grants. Recently, I was granted a $1 million grant from the State through the advocacy of Senator Linda Holmes. We will use this money to increase our efforts to combat the Domestic Violence issues. \n\nI have been an attorney for over 22 years having worked as a prosecutor for 16 years, 4 years in private practice and 2 years in legal Aid. During my time as a Kane County resident, I have worked for our community volunteering for organizations, providing free legal assistance, and serving on boards like Mutual Ground. I have dedicated my life to serving the Kane County community in a variety of ways. That level of service is what I have brought to the Kane County State's Attorney's Office. Since day one of taking office, I have improved on how we prosecute cases by creating vertical prosecution units. I have researched and created innovative programming that is designed to help get people out of our system while focusing our resources on keeping those who make our community unsafe in jail or prison. I have proven in 4 years that I can make our community safer with this balanced approach.\n\nYes, I do. When the SAFE-T Act was passed, I was one of the first democrats to object to it for a variety of reasons. While I support the concepts behind the SAFE-T Act and the elimination of cash bail, the language contained within would have created many negative consequences for our County. Myself along with DuPage SA Berlin and others in law enforcement worked with the legislators to pass three trailer bills that significantly improved the law. It is those changes that made the Safe-T workable. While there are more changes that are needed, we have seen that dangerous offenders do not have the ability to pay their way out of jail any longer. Low level, non-violent offenders are not being held because they cannot post bail. I am committed to continue to work with the legislators to expand the case that should be detainable based on what we have seen over the past year since its implementation. Additionally, I provided training to all Kane County law enforcement and law enforcement throughout the State of Illinois on the Safe-T Act and the elimination of cash bail making it so that our implementation of the law on 9/18/2023 was as seamless as possible. \n\nAs the State's Attorney, I do not have a role in deciding where tax payer funds should be directed. I am the legal counsel for the County and do not opine on policy. \n\nAs the State's Attorney, I cannot advise municipalities regarding issues such as this.\n\n"},

There are so many kids out there who are sick.\"\n\n for children ages 5 to 9, behind accidents, while it is the third leading cause of death for children ages 10 through 14 behind accidents and self-harm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n and adolescents aged 0-19 years old develop cancer each year, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nChildhood cancer is not one disease — there are more than 12 major types of pediatric cancers and more than 100 subtypes, according to Children's Cancer Cause.\n\n do not play \"much of a role\" in a child's risk of getting cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"Some of these cancers in adults are impacted by things that they do,\" Belous said. \"Smoking, vaping, health things, eating and nutrition-wise. These kids, they didn’t even have a chance to go to a party and vape or anything. They are as innocent as they come, and they deserve the opportunity to grow up, be something amazing, and contribute to the world in a positive way.\"\n\n.\n\nValerie Cusumano \n\n, a charity dedicated to supporting children diagnosed with cancer and their families, after the diagnosis of her son, Vinny. Since childhood cancer is near impossible to prevent, she said, the only hope of saving children lies in better treatment options, vaccines, and cures.\n\n\"Kids aren't smoking and more prone to lung cancer,\" Cusumano said. \"Kids aren't baking in the sun for years on end and more prone to skin cancer. Kids aren't doing anything other than being kids and they are still getting cancer.\"\n\nVinny was diagnosed with the \"very rare\" malignant renal rhabdoid tumor at the age of 10.\n\n\"It is normally something that is seen in children under age 3,\" Cusumano said. \"It's unheard of for a 10-year-old to have it. The fact that he was older allowed his oncologist to pump him with 'the kitchen sink' of chemotherapy.\"\n\nVinny completed chemotherapy on June 4, 2023 — 32 weeks to the exact day of his diagnosis.\n\nAll the chemotherapy Vinny had was designed for adults, however, Cusumano said.\n\n\"It was only approved for children by the FDA after it was approved for adults,\" she said. \n\nSylwia Jasinski, a doctor of pediatric hematology-oncology at NYU Langone Health, was Vinny's oncologist. Most chemotherapy treatments are originally developed and tested in adults with data then adapted for pediatric use, Jasinski said. The adult treatments are modified to suit children considering differences in size and physiology.\n\n\"Only a few clinical trials have been initially designed specifically for pediatric patients,\" Jasinski said. \"While adult medications are used, the treatment protocols are tailored to children based on clinical trials in pediatric patients.\"\n\nJasinski said her clinic cares for a cohort of approximately 50 patients per year in all stages of their oncology treatment, in addition to a \"large program\" of long-term cancer survivors. She said it is \"disheartening\" to see only a \"small fraction\" of cancer research funding is dedicated to pediatric cancers, despite the \"unique challenges and aggressive nature\" of the diseases in children.\n\n\"Increased investment is crucial to advance research, offer hope, and ultimately save more children’s lives,\" Jasinski said. \"These children and their families suffer immensely with the diagnosis they are living through as well as their treatment. The least we can do is offer the most cutting-edge treatment to give them the best chance at survival.\"\n\nIf the NIH were to provide more funding for pediatric cancer research, the \"priority,\" Jasinski said, should be on developing treatments specifically designed for children, as opposed to relying on adapted adult therapies.\n\n\"This would include investing in targeted therapies and immunotherapies that are less toxic and oftentimes more effective for pediatric cancers,\" she said.\n\nThe priority solution Jasinski proposed to the federal government is to increase funding for pediatric-specific research. \n\n\"Currently, only about 4 percent of the federal budget for cancer research is allocated specifically to pediatric cancer research,\" Jasinski said. \"This means that out of the billions of dollars spent on cancer research annually, a very small portion is dedicated to understanding and finding treatments for cancers affecting children.\"\n\nOnly five drugs are approved \n\n by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and two by the European Medicines Agency, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nFunding should also support large-scale clinical trials focused on pediatric patients, as well as research into the unique biology of childhood cancers so new therapeutic targets can be identified, Jasinski said. She said another solution is to streamline the drug approval process to reach children faster — especially for high-risk or rare cancers.\n\n\"Enhancing supportive care measures to minimize treatment side effects and improve long-term quality of life should also be a key focus,\" Jasinski said. \"Our goal should not just be to every childhood cancer patient to be a survivor, but also to live a long, healthy life without long-term sequelae of their cancer or its treatment.\"\n\nCusumano said Vinny may never be able to have children because of the chemotherapy and radiation he received.\n\n\"We knew that before anything started,\" she said. \"It was a trade off we had to make because we needed him to be able to get to be an adult so he can have that conversation with a significant other. But it's completely unfair and more needs to be done for our kids to keep them safer from short and long term side effects.\"\n\n linked to chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other cancer treatments include increased risk of other cancers; increased risk of stroke; infertility; dental problems; early menopause; hearing loss; heart and vascular problems; loss of taste; lung disease; nerve damage; intestinal problems; memory issues; osteoporosis; digestion issues; reduced lung capacity; hypothyroidism; lymphedema; blood clots; joint or muscle problems; and more, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nThere are approximately 500K people in the U.S. who have \n\n, according to the NIH. \n\nThe \n\n in long-term survivors is cardiovascular disease, according to the NIH. Compared with the general population, childhood cancer survivors are eight times more likely to die from cardiovascular-related disease.\n\nCusumano said if the NIH were to increase funding for pediatric cancer research, funds would be best served on better treatment options and safer medications.\n\n\"I pray we can get to a day that we live in a world that cancer doesn't exist,\" Cusumano said. \"But I think we are far off from that. The sad reality is that it will affect more children every day. So we need to be able to get to a point that oncologists can deliver the devastating news to a parent, but then follow it up with having a medication, a shot, something that is designed for children to fix this. Something that was designed for a child's body. Something that takes into account that their body, all of their systems, their brain, everything is not fully developed yet.\"\n\nIn 2016, Rachel Antorino was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 12. She died at the age of 14 after 20 months of receiving \"outdated, toxic drugs\" used on adult patients, as well as \"experimental and ineffective treatments,\" said her mother, Aimee Antorino.\n\n\"Pediatric cancer research is widely underfunded,\" Antorino said. \"While there have been improvements over the years, success is not spread equally across cancer types or patients. Four percent is not enough! My daughter Rachel and so many other children deserve more!\"\n\nAntorino founded \n\n in her daughter's memory. The charity aims to boost awareness of pediatric cancers, raise money to find and fund cures, and help other children and families suffering from a cancer diagnosis and treatments.\n\nBelous said drugs designed specifically for pediatric cancer are needed.\n\n\"You won’t give your baby Advil because it’s not safe,\" she said. \"If your baby is teething, you’re not giving them adult Motrin. We’d be calling the CPS on you, because that’s not acceptable. That’s not even a thought. They make baby Benadryl and baby this and that. But if your kid gets cancer, it’s 'Why don’t we throw chemotherapy for a 75-year-old man at a 5-year-old female?' Where does that make sense? Chemo for anyone is not great. It’s for a kid, and that just blows my mind.\"\n\nOne girl that Belous helped through Whip Pediatric Cancer was Charlotte Grace York, who lived in Oklahoma. Charlotte was cancer-free when she died at 6 years old, but the impact of the treatment on her lungs is what killed her, because the treatment was not designed for someone Charlotte's age, Belous said.\n\n \"It’s the most frustrating thing, because it wasn't the cancer that took her, it was the treatment that took her,\" Belous said. \"That forever makes me so angry, because it’s so unfair for her family to have gone through the fight and put in the time and energy and the efforts to get her the best treatment, and for the treatment to be what killed her, I can’t fathom it.\"\n\nSchmidt said funding research is \"critical\" to finding cures.\n\n\"You may not see an immediate impact from research, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be giving,\" Schmidt said. \"The truth and reality is, is that research can and does save lives. There have been many breakthroughs in treatments for the more common adult cancers because of research. If we expanded and grew our funding for pediatric cancer research, we feel positive it will lead to better outcomes for kids. And as we all know, the kids are our future.\"\n\nMaggie's Mission, since its inception, has \n\n for malignant rhabdoid tumors pediatric cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering. The charity has also raised $50K for rhabdomyosarcoma research being done at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nChristopher Vakoc is a molecular biologist and a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The lab has a program on pediatric sarcomas, which prioritizes rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Vakoc is studying how to \n\n through genome-editing — or differentiation therapy — as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy, surgery or radiation. \n\nPatients and their families could be spared a \"great deal of pain and suffering\" if doctors could transform sarcoma cells into regularly functioning tissue cells, according to the laboratory.\n\nVakoc said more federal funding, as well as efficient ways for researchers to obtain grants, would have a \"huge impact\" on the pace of which they could make new discoveries.\n\n\"For a lab like mine to do the research we’re doing, I spend huge amounts of time writing grants and engaged in fundraising efforts,\" Vakoc said. \"That does pull me away from actually thinking about the science. Thinking about how can science deliver breakthroughs, it is a bottleneck that we don’t have enough funding and we have to work so hard to find it ... Funds are critical. We feel directly the impact of the pediatric research budget. We wish that it could be increased, of course.\"\n\nVakoc said there is a \"long ways to go\" in how close researchers are to achieving \"transformative change\" in how patients are cared for. Researchers are still pinpointing the target needed to convert cancerous cells back to normal muscle cells as an alternative to chemotherapy.\n\n\"It’s going to be a series of forthcoming discoveries that will be required to take the research to that next level,\" he said.\n\nVakoc is now fundraising to support work in exploring whether existing drugs can be repurposed as a rhabdomyosarcoma therapy using animal models. This specific research, which Vakoc said he is the \"most excited\" about, is expected to take a couple of years.\n\nThe \n\n launched in 2016 to accelerate scientific discovery in cancer research, encourage more collaboration and improve the sharing of cancer data, according to the NIH. The initiative aims to bring together patients, advocates, researchers, and clinicians \"dedicated to advancing research to end cancer as we know it,\" according to the government.\n\nCusumano said it \"sounds like a great idea,\" but there are problems with it as far as children are concerned: of the five priority actions addressed in The Cancer Moonshot, \"none are helpful to combat pediatric cancer.\" \n\n and said they are not helpful to children:\n\nCusumano said it is \"extremely frustrating as a parent\" to see government officials take action but then realize children are not benefiting from the efforts.\n\n\"To an outside observer, it would seem that the government is really trying to combat cancer, which they are,\" Cusumano said. \"However, none of it helps combat childhood cancer.\"\n\nWithout cancer risk factors for children and screening unavailable, parents are left to deal with a diagnosis when it arises, Cusumano said.\n\n\"As a parent, the last thing that you want to hear is that they are going to load your child with toxins in the hopes it works to cure what wasn't anything they could have controlled,\" she said. \"Reading the pamphlets before chemo begins that contain all the side effects will make any person sick. But in that moment, your back is against the wall. You have no choice. A doctor is telling you that we need to move quick and the chemo is the only option. So in a way, you feel like you are signing your soul away to the devil to hopefully cure your child by signing the consent forms. When the dust settles and you look more into the medications, and you realize that the majority of them were never designed for children in the first place, you become sick. The chemo put in you, I, or an 80-year-old person, is the same chemo they put into my 10-year-old son. They just lowered the dose. His body was/is still developing.\"\n\nCusumano said it does not make sense to put toxins into children or full-grown adults, but it is the only option for many. She called for \"better, safer, less toxic drugs\" and strategies specifically to treat pediatric cancer.\n\n \"We can't keep giving these kids the same things that full grown adults get and expect them to be OK in the long run,\" she said.\n\nSchmidt urged doctors and trained medical staff to listen to parents of children who complain of not feeling well. Before Maggie was initially diagnosed, Schmidt said her daughter's complaints were \"ignored\" by medical staff for months.\n\n\"We were brought into a little room, told she had stage 4 cancer and there was nothing they could do,\" Schmidt said. \"They pushed a little note towards us with the name of a drug that might help extend her life, not save it.\"\n\n until October 2016 but was first sick on Aug. 10, 2016 — just 18 days after doing her first and last Tough Mudder race, Schmidt wrote on Maggie's Mission website. \n\n, where she was found to have been bleeding internally because of what doctors thought could be a possible burst ovarian cyst or ovarian torsion, Schmidt said.\n\nSchmidt asked two surgeons at different hospitals to remove Maggie's ovary if it would save her life, but both felt it unnecessary, Schmidt said. Maggie complained of pain, on and off, for weeks after that. Each time, Schmidt said she and her daughter were dismissed.\n\nMaggie felt bad pain in her right ovary in October 2016. Medical officials thought it was a \"hematoma\" or leftover blood clot from prior surgeries and that Maggie's body would reabsorb it on its own, Schmidt said. The family was told to return in three months, Schmidt said.\n\nThe \"hematoma\" turned out to be a tumor which burst. Maggie's right ovary was surgically removed, and multiple masses were discovered in her abdomen, her mother said. Over a week later — Maggie hospitalized the whole time — the family was told Maggie had stage 4 small cell carcinoma that likely started in her ovary, and the best they could hope for was to extend her life.\n\n\"We were broken by the news — broken!\" Schmidt wrote.\n\nA scan in April showed major tumor growth, as well as new tumors. The family was told Maggie was dying and there was nothing more that could be done. The family hosted Easter, at Maggie's behest, and celebrated her birthday on April 19.\n\n\"It was an extremely difficult time for all of us, singing 'Happy Birthday' to Maggie, knowing it would be the last time we would ever sing those words to her,\" Schmidt said.\n\nMaggie died June 1, 2017.\n\n\"Too often pediatric cancers go undiagnosed and when they finally are, it's too late,\" Schmidt said. \"Like in Maggie's case.\"\n\nJasinski said she takes a \"family-centered\" approach to oncology care. She recognizes that a child's wellbeing is linked to the support and involvement of their family and support system and encourages shared decision-making. \n\n\"It’s about actively listening to the family’s values, concerns, and goals for their child's treatment, ensuring they feel heard and respected,\" Jasinski said. \"It means presenting information clearly, discussing all available options, addressing uncertainties, and working together to choose the best course of action, always considering the child's quality of life and the family’s hopes and preferences.\"\n\nWhen caring for a child battling cancer, Jasinski said she feels a mix of compassion, awe at the child's bravery, and a \"profound sense\" of urgency.\n\n\"Seeing their courage is inspiring and heartbreaking, especially knowing that the treatments available are often not tailored to their unique needs,\" Jasinski said. \"This realization brings a feeling of frustration knowing that with more resources and dedicated research, we could offer these children more effective, gentler therapies that would give them a better chance at recovery and less chance at long-term side effects.\"\n\nVakoc said he believes federal funds are prioritized to support projects with proven feasibility and less risk, which can limit creativity on applications for government funding.\n\n\"I would say for the NIH, because there’s a public mandate to be responsible with public funds — taxpayers’ dollars — they want to see some proof of evidence that [research is] going to work,\" Vakoc said. \"...There’s kind of a paradox there that some of the best, most creative, original ideas might look too risky for the NIH government funds.\"\n\nVakoc said that NIH risk management is not a bad thing and is a \"necessary part\" of its responsibility to the public.\n\n \"But what’s needed as a complement to that is funding mechanisms that can explore bold ideas that don’t have as much of a requirement for demonstrated feasibility,\" he said. \"That is where foundation funding is most powerful. Every foundation is different, but often, they’re drawn to big, bold ideas. Usually, the folks who run the foundation have the authority over how they want to spend the funds they raise. When you put those two things together, it allows for more funding for higher risk, higher return ideas. My lab does a lot of very bold experiments. That is why we’re so grateful for the funds that Maggie’s Mission and others have raised for us.\"\n\nCusumano said pediatric cancer advocates \"often feel forgotten\" because of the rare nature of cancer diagnoses in children, and more attention is given to breast cancer awareness in October than to pediatric cancer awareness the month prior.\n\n \"Everywhere you look, it's pink ribbons when we are not even out of September — Childhood Cancer Awareness Month — and schools and businesses are already full throttle into October and breast cancer awareness. Even in school districts, they are already selling pink shirts. And I'm not taking anything away from any breast cancer warriors. However, there is so much less recognition for childhood cancer. And less recognition means less funding to help us battle cancer.\"\n\nCusumano said most people pushing and fighting for childhood cancer patients are their parents.\n\n \"We are an already exhausted population from having to go through the childhood cancer battle with our own child,\" she said. \"We then have to pull on the fumes that we have left to fight so hard for our kids to get a fraction of the funding, research, awareness and recognition.\"\n\nBelous called on professional sports franchises and airlines, among other entities, to raise the same level of awareness for childhood cancer as is done for breast cancer in October.\n\n\"Yes, donate to breast cancer and donate to all cancer research to support it,\" Belous said. \"But where’s the gold in September? I don’t go to a grocery store and see gold. But they’re selling pink socks, or they’re promoting all this research, but it’s never highlighted for the kids.\"\n\nCusumano urged action, awareness and more government funding, because given the lack of risk factors surrounding childhood cancer, it could happen to anyone.\n\n\"In a million years, I never thought this would happen to us. It wasn't us, until it was us,\" she said. \"It happened that quick. Each and every doctor and nurse we encountered throughout our journey has been incredible. [Vinny's] oncologist, Dr. Silwia Jaskinski, saved his life and we will never be able to repay her for giving us our son back. She, along with all the other doctors that consulted and nurses that worked with us, did the absolute best they could do with the knowledge and resources they had available to them. We need to give them more. We need to give our kids more. We need to prioritize them because even though pediatric cancer is considered rare, one is too many. It's not rare when it affects your child and your family. And it can happen to anyone in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nBelous said pediatric cancer is \"not as rare as you think.\"\n\nAbout 1 in 260 U.S. children will develop cancer before the age of 20, according to Children's Cancer Cause.\n\n\"It’s so overlooked and so underfunded, obviously,\" Belous said. \"Even the awareness part of it, we need to do better. Awareness leads to funding, funding leads to research, and then research leads to a cure. I think that this is a crucial part of this whole thing. If you can’t donate or it’s not in your immediate plan, then at least be aware that this happens every single day, and that this many kids are diagnosed every single day. I would like to see some big corporation step up in a huge way.\"\n\nJasinski called for legislation that would mandate pharmaceutical companies to participate in pediatrics trials, even if it is \"less lucrative.\"\n\nShe urged state lawmakers to ensure that every child, regardless of socioeconomic status, has access to cutting-edge treatments by expanding insurance coverage, supporting patient assistance programs, and funding travel and accommodation for families seeking specialized care.\n\n, a 10-year-old Florida girl, during her fight with rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\n\"We keep saying, 'The world needs her,'\" Belous said. \"It would be so dull without her. She’s such a light.\"\n\nTessa Marie Prothero was another girl who Belous helped through Whip Pediatric Cancer. Tessa died of stage 4 neuroblastoma in 2017 at the age of 9. Belous plans to continue fighting for cures in memory of Tessa and other children she's met through her charity.\n\n\"I always say, ‘Why does bad stuff happen to good people?’ It really seems like the most innocent, pure kids are getting sick,\" Belous said. \"They’re wise beyond their years.\"\n\nBelous urged people to consider what children could have gone on to accomplish had their lives not been snuffed by cancer decades too early.\n\n \"If Tessa was still here, what she would’ve been able to do would have been insurmountable,\" she said. \"She was such a strong force of nature. Her energy brought so many people together. I always wondered, 'If somebody cared a little bit more and gave a little more to her research-wise, what would she have been doing now in high school? What would she be doing 10 years from now?' I think that’s a really scary but true thought. What could these kids have been impacting? What would their mark be on this world? They don’t get a chance to grow up. That’s the saddest part here. Why they deserve more funding and why they should focus on the new minds of little kids. Letting them change the course of the world and where it’s heading.\"\n\n"},

Students have been involved with the planning of menu items, calculating food costs and other decisions involved with operating a hospitality business.\n\n\"We wanted to take it up a little bit and present it in a high-end fashion with tablecloths and fine China, a hostess station, sit-down meal, and students cooking and serving the food,\" he said. \"It goes A-to-Z into the whole operation of a restaurant.\n\n\"They get to really get a sense of the whole process of being a restaurant owner from the business side to the operation side.\"\n\nSousa said the need to develop those skills led the school to open a hospital management program to complement the culinary arts program.\n\n\"This really highlights what a CTE can be in a comprehensive program,\" Sousa said. \"It takes the right staff and the right students who want to do the right thing. If the teachers believe in the kids, the kids will shine through. That's the biggest thing.\"\n\nSousa said one the key changes in the culinary arts program in recent years are the signs of pride that students are taking in it — from restaurant necessities like owning and utilizing hair nets, to how every one of them now wears a uniform with the program logo on it.\n\n\"That helps kids sell the program to other kids,\" Sousa said. \"They are the ones showing the ninth-graders that this is what we do here.\"\n\nThe Black Cat Bistro menu will be revolving with \"fresh, creative dishes\" introduced at various times and chosen by students.\n\nThe bistro is located on the first floor in the rear of the building.

It looks like it’s been here for years. And in a good way, it doesn’t stand out;\" said Toselli. \"The fence is brand new and white, but the rest of it looks like it’s been here for years and years.”\n\nWoldorf said in addition to providing open space in the heart of town, the park preserves an important piece of the town’s past reaching back to before the Revolution.\n\n“While this may be Newtown Borough’s newest park, this land reflects over 350 years of Newtown history,” she said. “The Bird In Hand, the building on the front lot, was built in 1686 making it the oldest frame building in Pennsylvania. It was a tavern and hotel until 1858. Through the years it has also housed a quartermasters house and a jail for the Hessian soldiers who Washington captured while crossing the Delaware. Over the years it has also been a bakery, a grocery, a tin shop, a barbershop, a post office, residences and governmental and professional offices.” \n\nThe property was also part of the original six squares purchased in 1725 by the county creating the foundation for how the town would be developed as the county seat. \n\nIn addition, the land was the site of a 1778 skirmish during the Revolutionary War when Loyalists raided the Bird-In-Hand and stole 2,000 square yards of woolen felt that was to be made into uniforms for Washington’s Army. During the skirmish, five Patriots were killed, four were wounded, 11 were taken prisoner, and 2,000 yards of cloth were destroyed or taken\n\nNewtown Borough purchased the property in 2019 to turn it into a park, to save the land from development and to preserve some green space in the borough.\n\nWoldorf spearheaded the park project for the borough, obtaining the grants that paid for the land and development of the park and then oversaw the design and implementation of the project.\n\nFunding for Patriots Park was provided by grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Keystone Recreation, Park and Conservation Fund; the Bucks County Municipal Open Space Program; the PECO Green Region Open Space Program; and local donors.\n\n"},

Light is a former resident of Los Angeles, where the original heist took place, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors don't believe Light is the thief who stole the Warhol print — a trial proof depicting former Soviet Union leader Vladimir Lenin and was print number 44 of 46 total by Warhol — in early 2022 from a home in Los Angeles County.\n\nBut Light played a role in trying to sell the ill-gotten print worth about $170,000, according to prosecutors. \n\nAfter being burglarized, the victim informed law enforcement of its theft as well as the original gallery in West Hollywood that sold him the artwork, according to investigators. \n\n\"Days after the theft, the thief brought the artwork to a pawnshop, which purchased it.

Under the district's interpretation, anyone taking footage at any school event would need to get the permission of everyone who might be recorded, whether intentionally or inadvertently, she said.\n\n\"We all know that is not the case in D86, as recordings are made all the time and posted all over social media sites.

Some of the demonstrators blocked entrance gates, with one of them \n\n in a show of defiance.\n\nThe plastics manufacturing company \n\n at their Livingston location, who provide the majority of its “business support operations” such as management, marketing, sales, legal and logistics.\n\nNearly 100 people took part in the demonstration, most of whom voluntarily left the property at the request of local police, authorities said. The company told employees to work from home on the day of the protest, but did not shut down operations.\n\nTwo of the arrested protesters have since pleaded guilty to the trespassing charge and received fines. But the remaining four took their case to trial, pleading not guilty at an initial hearing in Livingston Municipal Court. \n\nLast week, the activists held an online media briefing about their legal strategy and plans to fight the charges (watch the video below, or \n\n).\n\nA second pretrial hearing took place on Sept. 26. During their follow-up court appearance, a municipal judge denied the activists’ request to admit expert testimony in support of a “necessity defense” – a \n\n that attempts to prove that a person’s illegal conduct was the “lesser of two evils.”\n\n“This is not going to be a political court for some kind of environmental agenda,” Livingston Municipal Court Judge William Williams told the defendants and their attorney, who said he would be appealing the ruling to the New Jersey Superior Court Law Division – putting a trial on hold for now.\n\n“The court’s decision indicates it does not take seriously the magnitude of the harm caused by Formosa Plastics to people’s health and livelihoods, to the climate and to the environment,” argued Paula Rogovin of Teaneck, one of the self-dubbed “Formosa Four” arrested at the Livingston protest.\n\n“Refusing to listen to the experts means that Formosa Plastics, which has its U.S. headquarters here in New Jersey, will continue to pollute and harm communities around the world and write off ongoing fines as the cost of doing business,” Rogovin alleged.\n\nDiane Wilson, a fourth-generation shrimper and Goldman Environmental Prize winner, said she was “shocked and dismayed” that the judge denied their request.\n\nAnother of the arrestees, Robin Schneider, the executive director of Texas Campaign for the Environment, said the accusations against Formosa are a “far worse crime” than blocking the employee entrances at the corporation’s headquarters.\n\n“We are in the midst of an urgent planetary crisis–the crisis of plastics pollution, which is intimately linked to climate change and environmental racism,” agreed fellow Formosa Four member Matthew Kennedy, adding that “civil disobedience is a necessary response.”\n\nAccording to its website, Formosa Plastics has revenues that top $5 billion.

It was founded by Jarret Schecter, a North Jersey-based photojournalist who was inspired to get young people more involved in a global society, and has now partnered with 46 schools in the Garden State. \n\nSeveral of the other schools have already helped the village of Miravalle, Ecuador build a new community center alongside a local organization called \n\n (the Spanish word for \"roof\" or \"ceiling\"). Now, the PCTI STEM students will work to support Miravalle further, by getting the residents access to electricity and running water. \n\n Taylor D'Alessio, the Executive Vice President of TEEEM, said the students will also learn more about Ecuador, discuss the challenges Miravalle faces, and gain a deeper understanding of how they can make a difference through civic action and engagement. \n\n\"We've created a social entrepreneurship program that allows students to not just learn, but take action by creating events within their own community to help raise funds for the communities that they're supporting worldwide,\" she said. \n\nShe explained that this also includes students using their business skills to figure out how to maximize the resources they already have as they work towards their goal. \n\nD'Alessio said that PCTI STEM Academy principal Joaquim Johnson connected the organization with several teachers at the school, to discuss how they could incorporate TEEEM's curriculum into their freshman seminar classes. \n\n\"We met with the teachers a few times and talked about what their goals were for the freshman seminar, because it was a brand new addition to the school,\" D'Alessio said. \"And then the teachers ultimately picked which site they wanted to support; in this case, it was Ecuador.\" \n\nTEEEM connects students with eight other communities around the globe, and one in the United States: At South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Reservation and in Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Peru, Uganda and Ukraine.\n\n\"Towards the end of the year, (the students) are going to learn about civic action,\" she said. \"Not just learning about these communities, but what can we actually do about it?

Officers learned that a confrontation happened at the home involving a woman and Ranstead, an off-duty Joliet Police Department detective.\n\n\"It is alleged that during an argument, Ranstead grabbed the victim by her shoulders and forced her toward the doorway of a second story bedroom. It is believed Ranstead then pushed the victim out of the room, causing her to strike her head on an adjacent door frame,\" Joliet's arrest report said.\n\nThe victim forced her way back into the bedroom and tried to call 911 at which time it is believed Ranstead took the phone from her, the arrest reports reflect. \n\nRanstead's victim was eventually able to contact 911 and Ranstead was not at the home and was unable to be located, upon the arrival of Joliet police officers, the police agency noted.\n\nOn Tuesday, other Joliet Police detectives obtained a Kendall County arrest warrant for Ranstead on two counts of domestic battery and one count of Interference with the reporting of domestic violence. \n\nRanstead turned himself in on Wednesday shortly after 6 a.m. at the Kendall County Sheriff’s Office in Yorkville.\n\nAs for the detective's employment status at Joliet PD, Ranstead has been placed on administrative leave following his arrest, his employer said.\n\n“The Joliet Police Department holds itself to the highest standards of integrity and accountability,\" Chief Bill Evans said in Wednesday evening's press release. \"When these standards are not met, we not only compromise our legitimacy but also erode the public’s trust.\n\n\"The community expects us to lead by example, and when one of our own fails to meet these expectations, it affects us all. Being a police officer is not just a job, it is a calling that requires each of us to live a life without reproach. I expect my officers to embody the values of integrity, respect, and fairness in both their personal and professional lives. This is critical not only to maintain the trust of the public, but also to preserve the honor of wearing the badge. When any officer fails to uphold these principles, it diminishes the hard work and dedication of all those who serve honorably. Our duty stands now to remain committed to transparency and impartiality and ensure that justice is served.”\n\n"},

", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/newlenox/use-our-grief-good-friends-create-curated-care-package-business", "article": "NEW LENOX, IL — Two former colleagues who grew into friends are bringing a very special idea to fruition. Inspired by a bond forged through life's trials, celebrations and challenges, the two have transformed their shared experiences into a business to help others. \n\nKelly Hickey, of New Lenox, and Katelyn Walker, of Frankfort, first met as special education teachers in an Orland Park school district. They leaned on each other through life experiences, finding comfort and sharing joy. Their time together as teachers came to a close, but a partnership had taken root. \n\n\"We both were thrown a lot of curveballs over the last five years we’ve known each other,\" Hickey said. \"... We’ve been through many highs and lows. We started to talk about how to support similar milestones, and helping other people support their loved ones in the same way. That’s kind of how Compassion Packed Gift Co. was born.\"\n\nThe pair felt compelled to create a way of providing the same support and compassion that had pulled each of them through so much. \n\n\"I speak for myself—a lot of times it’s hard to ask for help, we don’t know how someone can help us,\" said Walker. \"... Something that you can buy, leave on somebody’s doorsteps, that they know that they’re cared for and loved.\"\n\nWalker and Hickey began exploring the idea of curated gift boxes. Each custom-packed box contains items they've hand-picked for the recipient and the occasion. \n\n\"We designed the boxes from experiences we’ve gone through ourselves,\" Hickey said. \"We make sure the items are purposeful and chosen with intent, because they’re things that we’ve lived and know what can be helpful in supporting someone.\"\n\nBoxes range in purpose from new baby and parent boxes, caregiver support, sympathy and loss, get well, chemo support, adoption, new home and holiday collections. After months of design for the initial products, Compassion Packed will celebrate its soft launch on Oct. 11.\n\nThe concept took some time to come into focus for the pair. They knew they wanted to start a business, but weren't quite sure what it would be. \n\nWalker, who welcomed daughter Ellie in November 2023, said much of her inspiration comes from her own experience as a new mom.\n\n\"When people would leave something on the doorstep, it brightened my days,\" Walker said. \"We want to be able to bring this happiness, this joy, this support to people. It’s just nice to know that you have somebody thinking of you. We want to be able to treat people that they know they’re loved, and they’re supported.\"\n\nHickey's motivation flows from another source: her children. Two of Hickey's three children have Down syndrome. \n\n\"I would say the seed was initially planted to start a business someday that would employ people of all abilities, when I welcomed my two children who have Down syndrome into my family,\" Hickey said. \"Dreaming that one day we would have something that would provide them opportunities. \n\n\"I had no idea what that would look like, or when that would come to fruition. We just kept living our lives, and figured when the time was right it would come to us.\"\n\nTheir vision is to one day provide a workshop space that can create employment opportunities for people of all abilities. In the meantime, they plan to create partnerships with local transition and adult day programs to highlight the talents of our community members with intellectual and developmental disabilities—spreading the message of acceptance and inclusion through their gift boxes. \n\nThey plan to release the full collection of boxes slowly, first starting with a holiday box featuring a gingerbread collection, a teacher/educator box, new baby box, and a caregiver/healing box. The latter, for example, will include tea, an eye-shaped pillow, essential oil roll-on, a mug, lemon honey lollipops, and a book Walker was gifted in a time of need. \n\n\"\n\n,\" Walker said. \"It’s really something that you can turn the page at any time, and it will most likely be able to fit the current situation.\"\n\nAlso included in the boxes will be greeting cards hand-drawn by Hickey's children Sofija, 9, and Tadija, 8. \n\n\"We’ll be slowly releasing new options, continuously working with other people,\" Hickey said. \"There’s so many circumstances, we want to make sure we get it right.\"\n\nThey also plan to partner with other small businesses. \n\n\"We are looking for other businesses that are making an impact in the community, so that we’re also supporting other small businesses, as well,\" Hickey said. \n\nFollowing its soft launch on Oct. 11, Compassion Packed will also appear at the \n\n in Bolingbrook. The event is run by parents and families of individuals with Down syndrome. The 1-mile walk supports local individuals and groups involved with making a better life in the Down syndrome world.\n\n\"It means a lot to me,\" Walker said. \"It’s an incredible opportunity for us to be there, and people to come out and see what we have.\"\n\nHickey said they're trying to build the business gradually, though their hearts are all-in. \n\n\"We just have such big dreams for what this can be, and it’s checking ourselves into reality, and knowing that it’s going to take us time to get there,\" she said. \"Our dream is to have a workshop space or storefront where we have people of all abilities working alongside us. All four of our children working alongside each other. I know we’re so eager, that’s our passion.\"\n\nA \n\n Gift Co. will be live by Oct. 11, displaying options available during the soft launch. Initially, they will offer pick-up and local delivery to Frankfort, Manhattan, Mokena, New Lenox, and Orland Park—but they welcome pickup orders from anywhere. They aim to begin shipping orders in the new year. \n\nThey just didn't want to wait to share their gifts. \n\n\"We just really wanted to be sure we could get out there for the holiday season, really reach and meet the community to get started,\" Hickey said. \"This business has just come so naturally for us because our hearts are in it. It’s something we’ve lived, it’s something we’re still working through. It’s helping us use our grief for good. \n\n\"It’s been such a blessing, such an outlet for us. We have so much more for us to give, it’s just going to take us time to get to that point.\" \n\n"},

Another said it feels like Ukraine.", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/lagrange/la-grange-blasting-complaints-increase", "article": "LA GRANGE, IL – Residents in La Grange and Brookfield have been colorful in their descriptions of quarry blasting in McCook. \n\nOne said an explosion \"sounded like the whole upstairs was falling in.\" Another told a complaint hotline she didn't appreciate \"the house moving.\" Yet another said, \"I feel like I am in Ukraine. Maybe Brookfield should be called Little Ukraine.\" \n\nOver the last three years, complaints about blasting at quarries in McCook have increased, according to the companies' data. \n\nIn particular, complaints from La Grange residents have spiked. The others are from neighboring Brookfield.\n\nUnder a longtime arrangement, quarry owners Heidelberg Materials and Vulcan Materials \n\n (1-866-934-3278). They regularly provide information on the blasting and complaints to area towns. \n\nThrough a public records request, Patch obtained the blasting complaints going back to 2022. \n\nIn 2022, the companies reported 60 complaints, with only six coming from La Grange residents. \n\nIn 2023, 252 complaints were recorded. Of those, 189 were from La Grange residents. For the first eight months of this year, the hotline received 157 complaints, 94 of which were identified as coming from La Grange. \n\nIt's believed that Heidelberg Materials' blasting most affects La Grange. \n\nIt's unclear why there has been an increase, particularly in La Grange. Since fall 2022, La Grange Trustee Beth Augustine has repeatedly brought up the blasting during Village Board meetings. She has touted \n\n in which residents discuss the problem.\n\nIn October 2022, Augustine told her colleagues about what she said was the \n\n in her 10 years in the village. She was referring to the blast on Oct. 10, which drew seven complaints, tying for the highest among blasts that year, according to the quarries' data.\n\nIn February 2023, Augustine told the board she was again \n\n by another big blast, which drew one complaint on the hotline – from Augustine. At the meeting, she suggested the blasting affects local roads, pipes and homes, which Heidelberg Materials denied. \n\n\"You know when your house physically shakes and you're seeing new cracks on your walls continually,\" Augustine said at the time. \"That's not just an old house. It's happening to new houses as well in La Grange, Brookfield and Countryside.\"\n\nA few years ago, Heidelberg Materials, previously Hanson Aggregates, shifted from surface mining to underground, which Augustine has said makes a big difference.\n\nIn an email Wednesday, Heidelberg spokesman Jeff Sieg said his company understands that people have different experiences and responses when hearing or feeling a quarry blast, particularly if it is unexpected or takes them by surprise. \n\n\"Heidelberg Materials strives to be a good neighbor, and we are committed to operating in a safe and responsible manner at our Federal Quarry,\" he said. \"We make every attempt to minimize any impacts from our operations to our neighbors.\"\n\nSieg said the blasting is designed to be below the established threshold to prevent damage to nearby buildings, including homes. \n\n\"Looking at the data from the complaints, our blasts were well within the threshold to protect nearby structures from damage in all of these instances,\" Sieg said. \n\nIn an interview this week, Trustee Augustine said calling the hotline does not seem to help. She said residents get the same canned response: \"It's not damaging your home. Have a good day.\"\n\n\"I don't call much anymore. I know what's going to happen when I call,\" Augustine said. \n\nShe said she and others associated with the local Facebook group are gathering data, which they hope to present to regulators. \n\nAugustine also said the blasting has different effects on houses. One of her neighbors, she said, has no problem with it. Others do. \n\nSeveral factors such as changes in bedrock go into why some are impacted and others are not, Augustine said. \n\nAugustine said residents don't want to put the quarries out of business.\n\n\"We just want better regulation,\" she said.\n\n"},

Instead, it left them in the ground – and collected the payment anyway, prosecutors alleged.", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/newarknj/company-ripped-newark-left-lead-pipes-ground-feds", "article": "NEWARK, NJ — Several years ago, the City of Newark hired a company to replace lead pipes as part of its battle against water contamination. Instead, the company left them in the ground – and collected their payment anyway, federal prosecutors say.\n\nMichael Sawyer, 57, of Burlington, the chief executive officer of JAS Group Enterprise Inc., and Latronia Sanders, 55, of Roselle, a foreperson with the company, were arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe work in question was part of Newark’s Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) program, prosecutors said.\n\nFive years ago, Newark made national headlines when it confronted a lead water crisis. At one point, the lead levels at some points in the city’s drinking water had risen to 47 parts per billion at some sites, more than three times the federal threshold. It prompted an outcry from residents – and a lawsuit from advocates.\n\nNewark eventually identified two sources of the contamination. One was the way the city treated its water, which allowed excess corrosion to take place in aging pipes. The city responded by rolling out \n\n, which is also sold to several nearby towns and cities in Essex County.\n\nThe second issue wasn’t as quick of a fix, however.\n\nNewark officials traced some of the contamination to lead-lined service pipes leading to thousands of local homes. The pipes – which connect local homes and businesses to the local water supply – can potentially leach contamination as water passes through them. A portion of the pipes may be privately owned, complicating efforts to replace them.\n\nDespite the challenges and scope of the project, Newark has since replaced more than 20,000 lead service pipes, a massive effort that got a big thumbs up from officials including Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nBut earlier this year, a new speedbump emerged.\n\nIn February, officials \n\n that the city is carrying out a new audit of its drinking water infrastructure. The problem? A “third party” provider may not have done the job they were supposed to:\n\nState officials provided an update on the audit last month:\n\n“Importantly, the NJDEP has confirmed that Newark’s corrosion control treatment has been optimized to protect residents whose water may come in contact with plumbing that may still contain lead components,” officials said.\n\n“Newark has demonstrated compliance with the federal lead and copper rule,” state officials added. “Unless you are contacted by Newark to participate in an inspection of your service line, there is nothing you need to do at this time.”\n\nFederal prosecutors elaborated on the charges against Sawyer and Sanders in a statement on Thursday.\n\n“In March 2019, Newark announced plans to replace approximately 18,000 lead service lines within city limits as part of its LSLR program,” prosecutors said. “Newark hired an engineering firm to oversee the implementation of the program and contractors to complete the replacement work. JAS Group Enterprise Inc. (JAS) was one of the contractors hired by Newark. Prior to being hired as a contractor, JAS also worked on the LSLR program as a subcontractor for another construction company.”\n\nSawyer was the president and chief executive officer of JAS and responsible for overseeing and managing JAS’s operations. Sanders was employed by JAS as a foreperson of JAS crews assigned to replace lead pipes in Newark during the LSLR program, prosecutors said.\n\nHere’s what happened, prosecutors alleged:\n\nProsecutors continued:\n\nThe charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud is punishable by a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, twice the gross profits, or twice the gross loss suffered by the victims of the offense, whichever is greatest, prosecutors said.\n\n“Michael Sawyer and Latronia Sanders worked for a company hired by the city of Newark to replace lead pipes, but instead, they intentionally left lead pipes in the ground,” U.S. Attorney Phillip Sellinger said.\n\n“By causing misleading photographs and verification forms to be submitted, Sawyer and Sanders concealed that they intentionally did not replace lead pipes and defrauded Newark by collecting payment for work they did not properly perform,” Sellinger said. “Today, we begin the process of holding them accountable.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office held a news conference to announce the charges on Thursday.

And the town can get on with its life and start planning for the future.” \n\nSouth Brunswick negotiated the deal with Fair Share Housing Center, a nonprofit organization that negotiates affordable housing plans with municipalities across NJ. \n\n“Our opposition decided that they were tired of dancing,” Carley said. “The numbers were imposed upon us by the state.” \n\nThe Mayor told the community that the administration treads cautiously on development as it could lead to the potential for overdevelopment. \n\n“What we do with this agreement is it allows us to focus on development not on woodlands and farmlands, but on neglected property, particularly on the route 1 corridor,” Carley said. \n\n“It’s a sustainable path for the town. It won’t result in new schools being built, traffic is something we already have and we have to deal with.” \n\nThe Mayor said that another suggestion put forward was for the town to enter into a compromise that would have brought 9,000 housing units to town. Instead, South Brunswick decided to go with the option available resulting in 1,500 housing units. \n\nAhead of the 4th Round of Obligations starting in 2025, Gov. Phil Murphy signed \n\n (S50/A4) in March that sets a course for future enforcement of the Mount Laurel Doctrine. \n\nBy agreeing to the settlement, South Brunswick is steps ahead in the process. The agreement details 20 different sites where the township plans to build or redevelop new affordable housing. \n\nSouth Brunswick’s decision to settle is in stark difference to other towns. Last month, nine municipalities came together and sued to overturn the \n\n. \n\n“After many tumultuous years of litigation, South Brunswick is wisely getting ahead of the curve by planning now for the next decade,” Josh Bauers, director of exclusionary zoning litigation at Fair Share Housing Center said in a statement. \n\n “Good planning means planning in advance — this allows time for municipalities to find appropriate sites and develop strong partnerships to produce these much-needed homes.” \n\n"},

According to Pahira, the store’s roots go so deep that a liquor store around the corner from Colts Neck General got its liquor license from the General Store years ago.\n\n“This place has been a lot over the years,” Pahira said. “It was here before the Civil War, so it’s pretty neat just to have that kind of history tied in here.”\n\nThough Pahira has been the General Store’s owner since 2017, she’s been working with the store and the Colts Neck community much longer than that. \n\nIn 2008, Pahira was working at Delicious Orchards when she heard about the General Store for the first time. \n\nHer co-workers mentioned visiting the store for pork roll egg and cheese sandwiches (the store would later be \n\n in the state), and Pahira said they often took turns visiting the store to pick up food.\n\n“They’d [her coworkers] always say ‘This General Store, this General Store – you have to go to the General Store,’” Pahira said. “And I was like, ‘What the heck is the General Store?’”\n\nIt was late 2008 when Pahira finally got her answer.\n\nUpon visiting the General Store for the first time, Pahira said it wasn’t what she was expecting. \n\nThough she was surprised by the set-up of the store’s interior, it didn’t stop her from coming back. After visiting for a few months, one of the store's owners offered her a position to work there.\n\n“He said, you know, ‘do you want a job?’” Pahira said. “And I was like ‘yeah, okay. Sure.’”\n\nIn March 2009, Pahira officially began working at the General Store. Fast-forward to March 2017, and Pahira took over as the store’s official owner.\n\n“I worked other places over the years, but I always wanted a piece of the pie,” Pahira said. \n\nSince joining the General Store, Pahira said the building has undergone a few makeovers. In 2013, she said they gave the store “a little bit of a facelift” by painting and putting up pictures and decorations. \n\nYet the true store makeover came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Pahira said they re-did the building’s lighting, ceiling, and more while the store was shut down. \n\n“I did all of the displays where the register is, the flooring, the ceiling — it used to be a drop ceiling,” Pahira said. “We redid all of it.\"\n\nToday, the General Store is a hotspot for the Colts Neck community to gather, eat, and talk with one another, Pahira said. \n\nThe store is open for breakfast and lunch seven days a week, and offers everything ranging from food, to custom gift baskets, candles, baked goods, and more.\n\n“I look at it [the General Store] as like the heart of the town,” Pahira said. “You know? At 7 a.m. I open the doors, the coffee’s made, and I’ve got people already waiting to just get in and sit down and take up a whole table.” \n\n“And it’s important,” Pahira continued. “It’s nice being in a small town, being in a place like this — because it doesn’t feel like work. It’s awesome that this is where people want to come and hang out, and it’s an awesome experience to be a part of that.” \n\nTo learn more about the General Store, you can \n\n. \n\nThe Colts Neck General Store & Deli is located at 171 County Road 537, Colts Neck.\n\n"},

The actor's message is one of helping the younger generation be more informed and better off than the previous.\n\nWhen Macchio and Fierro saw Bruce Springsteen on Broadway, Macchio said one of his favorite moments was when Springsteen, now 75, discussed his age. \n\n\"[Springsteen] said, 'The thing I miss the most is the blank page. I don’t have that blank page anymore,'\" Macchio told Patch. \"It kind of hit me hard, because I’m like, 'I have room on my page, but it ain’t blank anymore.' So what do you do? What you do is, take a piece of the legacy and pay it forward. Take something that you feel is either profound or affected you in a way or educates you, and hand that to the next generation. I’m in the business of paying it forward now, personally. That inspires me, and I get inspiration from the younger generation. I think that’s my thing: Give back to Long Island and keep it flourishing. It’s home. This is home. When I’m here, I’m with my people.\"\n\nMacchio met Dr. Virginia Maurer when Fierro had a breast cancer scare. He said Maurer's \"beside manner\" was what stood out to him.\n\n\"The surgeons have the greatest hands but have the conversation ability of a lamppost,\" Macchio said. \"You meet a lot of surgeons — you need the great hands, because they’re surgeons. But when you’re dealing with something like this — and Phyllis is a nurse practitioner in palliative medicine — it is important to have that nurturing kind of enlightenment to educate and form and yet provide a comfort and feeling that you’re not in it alone. Dr. Maurer has that. We have not had any really intense scares, but there were some scenarios that were like, 'What if?' and that mountain it becomes in front of you at the time. And having someone hold your hand without holding your hand is something I recognized with her; she has that quality, as well as all the expertise — and the great hands.\"\n\n, based in Melville, in 1995. Maurer, the former chief of the division of breast surgery and former director of NYU Winthrop Hospital’s Breast Health Program, dedicated her professional life to the study and treatment of breast cancer, according to the Maurer Foundation's website.\n\nMaurer retired from the active practice of surgery in 2022. She and her foundation strive to promote breast cancer education. \n\nShe connected with Macchio and Fierro on a personal level and decided to ask Macchio to serve as the guest of honor at the foundation's 2024 gala. Macchio credited Maurer for calling him and making a pitch.\n\n\"She goes, ‘I just think you’re Long Island-based,'\" Macchio said. \"'You’re a Long Island son. We’re Long Island predominant, even though we reach globally or nationally, it’s still focused on the community.' She’s pretty persuasive. Not that she needed to twist my arm. But I don’t know if she was leaving without the answer she wanted to hear, and I respect that. I respect that. There are so many causes, and everyone’s worthy cause is the best one. I can only tell you the amount of, 'Oh, my brother’s sister’s ex-husband’s wife’s cousin has this charity. Can you come by?' And it’s all for good. But you have to sometimes tuck that football and drive to the end zone to achieve the goal, and [Dr. Maurer] did that. I’m proud to be here.\"\n\nThe Maurer Foundation's core message is promoting action through education. The foundation teaches people how to eat healthier, exercise, and perform breast self-exams.\n\nMacchio hopes to help amplify that message and encouraged school districts, camps and youth programs to allow the foundation to educate the next generation when it comes to \"early detection, inspiration and empowerment.\" \n\n\"Information is power,\" Macchio said. \"The more our young generation is informed, the more power they have over their own health, mindset. It's diet, it’s exercise, it’s not as simple as just the breast exams. I’d imagine it’s the whole scope of how you look at your life. If I see a teenager taking that care, it’s trickle down. Or trickle up. It’s contagious. I think the message is, the more schools and communities open their arms toward this, and obviously, raising funds to keep these programs free and accessible for young people, is what this whole night is about.\"\n\nEarly education inspires Macchio the most about the foundation, he said.\n\n\"Passing on the knowledge to the younger generation so they become empowered to carry that message forward and maybe save some lives and get ahead of it,\" he said. \"Any time you can make the next generation smarter than the previous, I think that’s good work to do.\"\n\nMacchio said he isn't sure if he's the right person to provide the educational speeches himself when it comes to breast cancer, but he said he would not pass on the opportunity, as he enjoys speaking with high schoolers and the community.\n\n\"I do that sometimes for movies I’ve been in like 'The Outsiders' or 'The Karate Kid,'\" he said. \"They’re sort of inspirational stories or stories where people feel connected to the character, so they’ll listen. In that sense, it’s another way to pay it forward.\"\n\nAn untitled \n\n, according to IMDB.\n\nDaniel LaRusso will be making an appearance. Macchio said the movie has been shot, and he relished the chance to work with legendary actors, as well as the next wave.\n\n\"I got to work with Jackie Chan, which was spectacular. This young kid, Ben Wang, does a great job,\" Macchio said. \"I look at 'The Karate Kid' as this mass universe and this is another ecosystem in there. It’s a new story being told. Daniel LaRusso is connected as the legacy character. The mythology to where it all began. Sort of the Luke Skywalker in all these incarnations. 'Cobra Kai' has some more episodes coming, and then the new 'The Karate Kid' film is another chapter in that vast - it’s like the Marvel Cinematic Universe - it’s 'The Karate Kid Cinematic Universe.'\"\n\n\"Cobra Kai\" is a show set decades after the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament where LaRusso squared off with Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). Now middle-aged themselves, LaRusso and Lawrence find themselves martial-arts rivals again.\n\nThe upcoming \"The Karate Kid\" film and \"Cobra Kai\" are their own entities, Macchio said, but LaRusso bridges in his life and story that makes sense and informs in different ways.\n\n\"It’s the same characters. It’s separated by time, 'Cobra Kai.' When you look at it, these six seasons were compressed into about three years. Otherwise, these kids would have been out of college by now. The new 'The Karate Kid' movie takes place in present time.\"\n\nMacchio, addressing Long Islanders, said this: \"Long Island: This is my home, my community. All my teams are doing OK. The Mets are doing OK. The Islanders. The Jets actually can move the football.\"\n\n"},

A “No” vote will result in the continuation of nonpartisan elections to be held in November. \n\nCurrently, West Windsor does not have primary elections and any qualified resident can run for mayor or council without any affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party. \n\nA residents group, \n\n is at the forefront of spreading awareness on keeping local elections nonpartisan. \n\nOn the website, the group says that Mironov, the Democratic County Committee boss, is trying to push the party agenda by supporting a partisan government in West Windsor. They also alleged that East Windsor would benefit if there was any dispute in West Windsor. \n\n“Janice Mironov came to the West Windsor council meeting on May 28, 2024, and threatened the council members in public that they will \"hear from us more\" if they don't change a decision she doesn't like,” the group says. “Immediately, the group to change West Windsor to a divisive partisan government was out collecting petitions, falsely telling voters it was to make the elections more transparent.” \n\nThe group says Mironov and East Windsor will benefit in multiple ways if West Windsor becomes partisan. \n\n“First, she will control who gets the party endorsement to run for Mayor and Council in West Windsor, thus directly controlling our government. County Chairs are the most powerful party bosses in NJ,” the group said. \n\nMironov has however rubbished the claims saying they were “filled with untrue and personal attacks.” \n\n“It is a sad reflection that the sender failed to do their homework and are trying to make another town and official their boogeyman,” Mironov said. \n\n“I attended a public West Windsor Council meeting accompanied by five East Windsor council members, plus spoke directly with the mayor and council members of West Windsor, residents of both communities, the county planning board and with project representatives – all to express our strong opposition to this ill-advised trucking project and ask how we could all work together to change this plan. The job of a mayor is to advocate and help make positive change for the public. My invitation to West Windsor officials remains open.” \n\nA \n\n does show Mironov speaking about warehouse issues, which will impact nearby towns, including Princeton and Lawrenceville. \n\nThe project in question is the 60-bay truck-generating warehouse on Princeton Hightstown Road, which was approved by the West Windsor Council. Mironov said that East Windsor, like \"large numbers of West Windsor residents and groups,\" opposes the project. \n\n\"This speculative development, inappropriately located west of McCaffreys and adjacent to the East Windsor border, will generate large amounts of truck traffic at all hours,\" Mironov said. \n\nMironov noted that mayors around the County often collaborate with one another on border development. \"As past President of the state NJ League of Municipalities and of the NJ Conference of Mayors, my reputation is well known as a partner with and advocate for mayors and officials of all political parties around the state on a variety of issues and legislation,\" she said.\n\nIn a conversation with Patch, members of the group said the ballot question was important as it could decide the future of the town.\n\nThe group says they don't want elected officials to be beholden to anyone other than voters, and this could change if the elections become partisan. \n\n\"As they start taking money from different parties, as parties start to influence who can run for office, and they start to provide funding so that people have a better chance of winning - that does a disservice to the residents of the town, who just need people to do what's in the best interest of the town,” Chairperson Andy Lupo said. \n\nResident and Vice-Chair Joe Charles said that people promoting the “yes” vote are trying to link it to the warehouse issue. \n\n“We've got independents, Democrats and Republicans, all on our side working up for this issue. If you look at the last town council election, it was very close. There were maybe 20 or so votes that separated the candidates. We want an open, fair election where a Democrat, Republican and independent can run together on the same ticket because they want to work together and solve local issues,” Charles said. \n\nComing back to Mironov, the group said the Mayor recently attended a private party at a home in West Windsor and spoke to attendees about the ballot question.

While I publicly spoke about the national election and the warehouse, I did not speak on the West Windsor ballot question,” the Mayor said. \n\n“West Windsor voters alone will determine the fate of the November 5 ballot question and will choose their own municipal candidates and elected officials – and to suggest otherwise wrongly impugns the knowledge and intentions of the good people of West Windsor.” \n\n"},

Pulling a black drape off the new sign was \n\n, who currently holds the same office as her late mother.\n\n“She was a natural organizer and natural born leader,” her daughter said in her remarks at the park dedication. “She was the first woman to be elected to Worth Township government in its 128 years of existence.\"\n\nAs a kid, Patricia Joan Murphy recalled there being a park before the expansion of the township hall parking lot.\n\n“I remember coming here as a kid, being in the hallways and camp, watching my mother do what she loved best,” Patricia Joan Murphy said.\n\nJoan Patricia Murphy was a Bostonian by birth. She attended the State Teachers College in Boston but the friendly skies beckoned. She became a United Airline stewardess and flew in the late 1950s. She was stationed in Chicago, where she met Leo High School graduate, Donald, whom she married in 1959. The couple settled in Crestwood where they would raise their four children: Donald, Jr., Timothy and Anthony. \n\n“Her interest in politics was inspired by President John F. Kennedy, but her interest in public service happened organically,” Trish Murphy recalled. “I remember neighbors coming to the door seeking help. They knew my mother was the person in town to come and ask. She would do something to help them, or find someone who could.”\n\nThe first elected office Murphy ran for was the village clerk of Crestwood, which she won in 1965. After serving one term, she became the first woman to be elected Worth Township Clerk, serving from 1977 to 1985. \n\nMurphy took a break from politics when she held a variety of public service positions, including a job developer for displaced steel workers, and an administrative assistant for the Cook County Circuit Court.\n\nWhen her husband, Donald, noticed that she lost the fire in her eye, he encouraged her to run for public office. This time, she ran for Worth Township supervisor – the third largest township in Illinois –and won, serving from 1989 to 1997. \n\nConcurrent with her township supervisor role, Murphy was a chief investigator for the \n\nfrom 1995 to 2002, until she decided to make a run for the Cook County Board of Commissioners. \n\nIn 2002, Murphy became the first female to be elected commissioner of the 6th District of Cook County Board, where she served until 2016 until breast cancer forced her to leave office. Murphy died at age 79 in 2016\n\n“She ran for 6th District commissioner in Cook County and served there until the day she wasn’t with us anymore,” her daughter said. “She joked about being taken out in a casket. She just died doing what she loved the day she was gone.”\n\nThe three-acre Joan Patricia Murphy Park includes a playground, benches, walking paths, a water feature, sheltered picnic area, and native plants and grasses. Calling the park a “passion project,” Patricia Joan Murphy extended her thanks to Sen. Bill Cunningham (18th District), State Rep. Mary Gill (35th District),\n\n, former State Rep. Fran Hurley, Alsip Mayor John Ryan, \n\n, Tim Klass with \n\n, \n\n, \n\n, \n\n and township employees. \n\n\"So many people called my mother a trailblazer, powerhouse, tough as nails and a dynamo,” her daughter said. “She was a true public servant at heart when she was working with residents. Everyone she helped got to experience how kind, giving, warm and generous she was. My mother was a loving and joyful person. She was good at this life.”\n\n"},

Every time you walk out your door, every time you go to work, every time you drive home on the highway, every time you go out to eat with your family, Congress has failed you,\" Cohen said.\n\nVoters hold Congress in increasingly low regard as an institution, but they generally support their local reps, according to Gallup polling. Though 57 percent of respondents said they had \"very little\" confidence in Congress and 67 percent said most members of Congress do not deserve to be reelected, 55 percent said the U.S. representative in their district does deserve to be reelected.\n\nThe Republican newcomer noted that only two people have represented the district in the past 75 years. \n\n\"So I know for me asking you to vote for me is difficult. Perhaps you don’t know me, you don’t trust me, the 'R' next to my name turns you off because you think that I’m a partisan or an ideologue,\" he said. \"That is not the truth.\"\n\nThe forum was co-sponsored by the Leagues of Women Voters of Arlington Heights-Mt. Prospect-Buffalo Grove, Evanston, Glenview-Glencoe, Wilmette and Winnetka-Northfield-Kenilworth and hosted by the Evanston Public Library via video teleconferencing software.\n\nThe ideological divide between the longtime lawmaker and the recent University of Chicago graduate was on full display, with the two candidates agreeing on little other than the need to protect Lake Michigan's water and send aid but not troops to Ukraine. \n\nSchakowsky advocated for a \"national way to vote,\" warning of more than a million people being \"purged from voting rights\" in Texas and other states.\n\nBut Cohen contended that elections should be held at the state and local level, suggesting that centralizing elections in the federal government would be a massive mistake. \n\n\"Just like Republicans complain about voter fraud, Democrats complain about voting rights all over the country,\" Cohen said. \n\n\"We see in Georgia more Black Americans are voting than ever before. To think that there’s a voting rights problem in America is just wrong. It’s just a lie,\" he said. \"It’s there to scare you into doing X, Y and Z. Just like there’s no voter fraud, anyone who wants to vote, who’s an American citizen, can vote in our elections.\"\n\nSchakowsky said she supported federal legislation to protect access to abortions nationwide, while Cohen said the Supreme Court correctly considers abortion a state issue and suggested the justices would strike down anything Congress passed on the matter.\n\nWhen asked what the federal government would do to provide high-quality education, Cohen called for shrinking the Department of Education and spending taxpayer money on private schools, explaining he does not believe the federal government \"has anything to do with education.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Schakowsky said state governments should not be allowed to limiting what lessons teachers teach. \n\n\"I believe that we have to make sure that our public schools are available to all of our children [with] quality education where they can learn everything they need to learn, where they are not hamstrung by views that many books have to be taken off the shelf, or that they shouldn’t be taught about things that may be uncomfortable, like the Civil War or like Holocaust issues,\" the congresswoman said.\n\nAs for taxes, Cohen said he supported a flat tax or small progressive tax of up to 12 percent with no deductions that could be filled out within 15 minutes. He acknowledged it would be difficult to get such a measure through Congress, which he blamed for tax loopholes that allow wealthy families and corporate officials to deduct taxes and game the system.\n\nSchakowsky said she supported reversing tax cuts to the wealthy passed under President Donald Trump and raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour. (Chicago's minimum wage is $16.20 per hour and the statewide hourly minimum is $14)\n\n\"We need to have a tax plan. We are not spending too much money,\" Schakowsky said. \n\n\"This is the richest country in the world right now. We can absolutely afford to make sure that people have the funds that they need,\" she said. \"We need to make sure that ordinary people have the funds they need.\"\n\nSchakowsky was asked what Congress should do to reduce gun violence.\n\n\"You know, it's simple, and we have figured it out in Illinois by passing a ban on assault weapons, that should be national,\" she said. \"The problem is because we have a ban on assault weapons, and this is supported by the majority of Americans.\"\n\nCohen pointed out that the number of gun-owning parents exceeds the number of school shootings.\n\n\"Guns are not the problem. Guns are not the issue. It's the Americans behind the guns,\" Cohen said, suggesting that the solution to gun violence is a \"healthier society.\"\n\nThe candidates also shared contrasting visions of foreign policy.\n\nCohen said President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Congress failed Israel, which he described as \"our greatest ally.\" He said the military operations conducted by the Israeli military over the past year continue only due to a a lack of U.S. support.\n\n\"There could be peace in the Middle East, but only if the American government wholeheartedly supports their closest ally, who helps them fight terrorists all over the Middle East, to annihilate Hamas, to annihilate Hezbollah,\" Cohen said. \"This is the only way to get safety for the Palestinian people. This is the only way to get safety for the Lebanese people, is if Hamas and all the terrorists in the region are killed.\"\n\nCalling for a ceasefire and a \"two-state solution\" with justice for Palestinians and safety for Israeli, Schakowsky said she was \"very disappointed\" in Benjamin Netanyahu's lack of efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict. \n\n\"What I’m looking at right now is that Netanyahu may actually be expanding the war, making it more than just Israel and Hamas,\" she said, referencing the Israeli military's invasion of Lebanon, which began Tuesday.\n\nBoth candidates supported sending continued military and financial aid to Ukraine to continue its war with Russia, and both opposed American boots on the ground.\n\n\"I definitely have Ukrainian blood running through my veins because that part of the Russian Empire was where my family came from, so I have a special feeling about that,\" Schakowsky said, having noted earlier in the forum that her parents fled antisemitic oppression in the late 19th Century. \"But it's certainly not personal. It's about the safety and consistency in the world and working with our allies.\"\n\nCohen said his great-grandmother also immigrated from Russia.\n\n\"I do believe in immigrants coming to our country who want to participate in the American experience, the American dream, but not when it costs the taxpayer hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars,\" he said. \"Solving this crisis is not hard, as we saw in the previous administration, and it could be solved in this administration.\"\n\n"},

The grocery store closed in June 2023.\n\nAlso approved was a zoning map amendment to rezone a portion of the property.\n\nDeCicco's \n\n this past June that it will open in summer 2025.\n\nRenovations to the site will include a 7,777-square-foot addition that will have an enclosed dumpster and loading dock area, a storage area, refrigeration storage, an entrance vestibule, second-floor mechanical and storage area, new rear entrance and parking lot expansion with a landscaped plaza, according to P&Z documents.\n\nThe parking lot will expand from 118 spaces to 178 plus 10 handicap spots thanks to the rezoning of the property.\n\nDuring the public comment portion, Executive Director of the Greenwich Tree Conservancy Kate Dzikiewicz voiced concerns over the tree removal that's needed to expand the parking lot.\n\n\"The property at 21 Glenville St. sits directly between the busy Merritt Parkway and nearby homes, meaning the loss of trees in this area will increase local residents' exposure to pollutants from the parkway.

We could make shadow puppets on the wall each night.”\n\nBeth installed room-darkening blinds, but wonders why “they couldn’t at least have them on a sensor.”\n\n“I have floods that are on motion sensors,” she said. “They go on when there is movement. I’m not lighting up the neighborhood all night long.”\n\n \n\nM’Lynn, a \n\n reader, said she already could not “see a single star in the sky” because of her neighbor’s bright lights when installed two more that are “so bright you can’t look at them.”\n\n“I have no need for a porch light on the side of my house,” M’Lynn said. Like Beth, she wondered, “Why can’t her lights be on a motion detector?”\n\nSeveral readers suggested getting local authorities involved to adopt and enforce light pollution ordinances. One of them was Jim, a \n\n reader who is involved in \n\n, an organization that promotes dark skies in the state.\n\n“Light trespassing is a private property rights issue,” Jim said.\n\nRather than single out a neighbor, \n\n reader Nattily Attired suggested getting all neighbors to sign onto a pledge with groups such as \n\n to turn off unnecessary lights during migratory bird season.\n\n reader Kari also wants to see more defined light pollution codes. \n\n“It’s one thing to have a light, but a spotlight is a whole other story,” Kari said. “It’s different if one lived on a farm with lots of property, but at a suburban home where houses can be closer together and smaller plots of land, it is not necessary and is inconsiderate of neighbors.”\n\n“We call this ‘light trespassing,’ and yes, it is awful,” said \n\n reader Nimue.\n\n“Many flowering garden specimens demand a day-night sequence, so now they cannot flower,” Nimue said. “Lighting so bright to elicit a confession. One would think that common sense would prevail — but no.\"\n\n“If your neighbor is using those lights all night long, they must be scared of crime,” said Lisa, who reads \n\n. “I would politely suggest they get some motion sensor lights.” \n\nOther readers argued bright lights aren’t an effective deterrent to crime.\n\n“It’s ridiculous,” said \n\n reader Dave, who questions the effectiveness of outdoor lighting as a crime deterrent. \n\n“No one should have to sleep with their neighbor’s lights in the bedrooms at night. It’s not healthy or neighborly,” Dave said. “Nuisance lighting needs to be regulated. Light trespass needs to be regulated. Use motion sensors and timers. Use low-color temperature LEDs. Use fully shielded fixtures,” Dave said. “Stop fearing the dark.”\n\n“There is \n\n that increased outdoor lighting deters crimes, \n\n reader Barbara wrote, citing DarkSky.com. “It may make us feel safer, but it has not been shown to make us safer.”\n\nShe added, “It seems most property crime occurs during the light of day, and it disrupts local wildlife, migrating birds.”\n\n“From what I see on Ring Neighborhood reports, lighting doesn’t deter prowlers at all,” \n\nreader Mickey said. “Turn on your light if you actually need to see something or you’re going inside, and then turn it off again.\n\n“Those floodlights are horrible,” Mickey continued. “Realize that even if your neighbors don’t say it, they hate your outdoor lights being on all night long.”\n\nAlso, Mickey said, “They attract water bugs, cockroaches and other little creatures.”\n\nHow about doing nothing? Several readers said that is a good approach. \n\n“Fume in silence,” said Dev, a \n\n reader. “It’s just rude, and I wonder how they’d react if someone did it to them” Dev said.\n\nCindy, a \n\n reader, took an understanding approach and got light-blocking window treatments. “If the neighbor is living alone, they probably do that for safety reasons.”\n\nJo, who reads \n\n, removed landscape lights at the back of her house when a neighbor across the lake complained they were shining into her house — “which was impossible as they were low voltage with a cover on them,” Jo said.\n\nShe polled her neighbors and none of them seemed to be bothered by the lights. \n\n“Nonetheless, I took down the lights as it was a concern to the new neighbor, who was crabby and nasty in her approach,” Jo said. “Then she decided she didn't like the neighborhood and moved out 6 months later. I never reinstalled the lights.”\n\n“Attitude is everything,” said JMC in Massachusetts, who reads \n\n, \n\n and \n\n.\n\n“If you confront neighbors in a hostile manner and make threats, it never goes well (that’s why Judge Judy is so popular),” JMC said. “If you focus on problem-solving, and try to see their point of view, it’s much more productive.”\n\nIt’s a good idea to know if local ordinances address exterior lighting before approaching the neighbor. \n\n“I would approach the neighbor in the spirit of partnership, sharing any information in a cooperative manner,” JMC said. “If other neighbors are also being affected, I would get them to join in, there is strength in numbers.”\n\n“A neighbor versus neighbor squabble is never fun to live around,” agreed fellow Floridian Winnie, who reads \n\n, \n\n and \n\n. “You have to be respectful of your neighbors.”\n\nThere’s also strength in numbers. Winnie’s neighbor installed bright LED security lights “got to be a little too much.” When a few other neighbors raised the issue as well, the neighbor turned off the bright lights.\n\n“I now have room-darkening shades plus room-darkening curtains in my bedroom. I sleep really well now, and it saves me from confronting the neighbor across the street who I hardly know,” \n\n reader said.\n\n reader Carol installed blackout curtains to avoid talking to her neighbors about their “very bright” lights — eight on the front of the house and five more in front of their garage.\n\n“They are not the type of people that you can talk to,” Carol said. “Makes you wonder what they are afraid of that they have to have all those bright lights.”\n\nAnd then there’s Mo, a \n\n reader mulling more drastic action.\n\n“I haven’t done anything yet, but am considering unscrewing the bulb on the one that shines right into my daughter’s window as well as two other windows,” Mo said. “They are the extremely bright kind.”\n\nBlock Talk is an exclusive Patch series on neighborhood etiquette — and readers provide the answers.

But residents (and certain officials) objected to an all-affordable housing development proposed for \n\n, which would provide 75 units for families. Some said that the building should have a mix of incomes, while others said they had environmental concerns with the site.\n\nMillburn has since joined eight other New Jersey towns in an attempt to overturn the state’s new \n\n. The law gives the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs the authority to run the development of affordable housing in the state – and determine how many units every town and city must build over the next decade.\n\nOther lawmakers – including the mayor of Millburn’s nearby Essex County neighbor, Newark – have supported the state’s new affordable housing regulations, saying that they’re necessary to make sure that every town is creating their “fair share” of housing for low and moderate-income residents. \n\nHowever, according to Montvale Mayor Mike Ghassali, who is spearheading the effort for the “Local Leaders for Responsible Planning” coalition, it’s not fair for towns like those in the lawsuit to be forced to support the housing needs of other municipalities, which are often significantly bigger.\n\nFriday’s statement from the township follows below (\n\n):\n\n“Millburn Township is extremely disappointed in the ruling handed down by the state appellate court on October 1, 2024, with regard to the township’s affordable housing obligations. \n\n“Millburn is proudly committed to providing affordable housing under the Mount Laurel doctrine to ensure our community reflects the economic diversity of New Jersey and the region. \n\n“However, the ruling by the appeals court will only delay the availability of affordable housing in Milburn. It is also a blatant example of the courts enforcing an inflexible process supported by Fair Share Housing throughout the state of New Jersey. \n\n“By continuing to insist that Millburn build a 75-unit development at 9 Main Street, Fair Share Housing is failing low- and moderate-income residents. It is showing complete disregard for its role and responsibility of ensuring affordable housing gets built by putting process over results. This is happening across many New Jersey municipalities and their involvement now reaches deep into Millburn Township.\n\n“Millburn has proposed and is committed to a sensible alternative to 9 Main Street that will provide 75 affordable family rental units with an additional 49 units of workforce housing in a shorter time frame without the need to relocate the existing Public Works operation and disrupt services. The alternative sites on town-owned land are mixed income, rather than all low income, which reduces potential stigma against affordable unit residents.\n\n“As a further commitment to affordable housing, Millburn made a decision to offer to donate these valuable properties through a redevelopment process to the eventual developer(s).\n\n“The property at 9 Main Street is not suitable for the proposed development because it is contaminated with toxic substances requiring extensive cleanup to make the property safe for residential development to limit exposure of future residents to toxins as well as liability to the township.\n\n“Furthermore, the relocation of the DPW site could cause catastrophic disruption of services, including emergency accessibility and response. The courts mandating this to occur after the devastating flooding brought by Hurricanes Irene, Ida, Floyd is unconscionable. \n\n“Despite 40 years of efforts, the township has not been able to identify a suitable alternative site for the future home of the DPW, which will result in further delays of affordable housing development as site selection, financing, engineering, and construction for a new DPW will require years of effort to enact.\n\n“Millburn continues to remain committed to providing affordable housing throughout the township. The town will continue to do what is in the best interest of its residents and fight the irresponsible manner in which these mandates are enforced.”\n\n"},

Developers plan to build a seven-story mixed-use building with 250 residential units, more retail and restaurant spaces and a parking garage. \n\nAnother eight-story building is also planned, which will include either a 200-key hotel or up to 125 additional residential units.\n\n\"I think we would want to certainly execute on phase one and see how it's going before we would commit to any sort of schedule on phase two, because it may dictate some changes,\" Pelej said.\n\nStephen Fluhr, senior vice president of development at URW, said company officials strongly preferred to build a hotel, citing its benefit to the \"cross-shopping experience\" and \"dwell experience\" of the shopping center.\n\n\"They see the power of the place creation that we are doing,\" Fluhr said. \n\n\"It can become a draw in an of itself. That said, if the macroeconomic environment doesn't allow for it at the time — or there simply isn't a deal in the hotel world — we have put in the application a conversation rate to 125 multi-family units for the site,\" he told plan commissioners. \"The reality is, if there's changes to the plan, we're going to back in front of this board.\" \n\nFluhr said company officials had a multiphase plan to relocate Barnes and Noble, which have to be moved for the first phase, and the Cheesecake Factory, which would be relocated for the second phase.\n\nThe Skokie Plan Commission approved the site plan on Aug. 15, and the village's appearance commission issued it a certificate of appropriateness two weeks later.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Skokie Village Board will consider the first reading of the proposed plans, with a second reading to be scheduled at a future meeting.\n\n"},

Teen years at Victor J. Andrew High School. Summer strolls along Oak Park Avenue, capped with dripping ice cream cones at Whitey's Dairy Palace. It's all crystal clear in her mind. \n\nIt only made sense to McLeod, then, that she share her wedding spotlight with the town that long ago grabbed hold of her heart, just as her now-husband Steven did years prior.\n\n\"I absolutely adore Tinley,\" McLeod said. \"I have a lot of great childhood memories there. It’s a lot of very awesome feelings for me.\"\n\nAs McLeod and Steve Stepien planned their big day, they decided to focus much of it—well, almost all of it—in Tinley Park's downtown. Each element tied in a bit of Tinley, from \n\nfor boutonnieres and wristlets, to a heart-shaped pizza baked specially for them at \n\n, capped with a sweet treat at \n\n. Her dress came from \n\n in Tinley Park. Alterations to wedding apparel were by Sara's Tailoring and Alterations, also on Oak Park Avenue. The rehearsal dinner was held at \n\n. Even the ceremony site was as local could be, and special to them. \n\nTucked behind a new-ish condo building, sits \n\n.\n\n\"Steve and I were walking down Oak Park Avenue, and every first Sunday of the month, the chapel is open,\" McLeod told Patch before the wedding. \"They asked if we wanted to ring the bell—every couple who gets married there rings the bell.\"\n\nThey were not yet engaged at the time they stopped in, McLeod said, but that changed in November 2023. The chapel seemed like a natural fit for their ceremony venue.\n\n\"It just reminds me of old school Tinley,\" she said, before their wedding. \"They haven’t had a wedding there in over a year. The condo building blocks it, so people forget it’s there.\"\n\nFrom there, the pieces for their Sept. 14 wedding just seemed to fall into place.\n\nA longtime dental hygienist at Dr. Gattone's office, McLeod continued plotting how she'd spotlight the town where she'd grown up, that she'd grown to love and where she chooses to stay. Along with their photographers from \n\n they planned a visual trip along Oak Park Avenue to follow their ceremony. \n\nMelissa had initially hoped to hold her reception at Banging Gavel Brews at the historic Vogt House, but opted instead to make it a focal point for photos afterward. Photographers followed the newlyweds along Oak Park Avenue, capturing images of essential Tinley scenes including the Vogt Visual Art Center's gazebo, the clock tower at the Oak Park Avenue Metra station, Village Pizza, Banging Gavel Brews and Whitey's Dairy Palace, as well as Zabrocki Plaza and the chapel. \n\n\"Our Tinley Park wedding went amazing!\" McLeod told Patch afterward. \n\nThe celebration kicked off with a sweet, cool treat—and a heart-shaped pizza. \n\n\"We had Kevin from Dairy Palace drive the Good Humor truck to the chapel,\" McLeod said. \"It was a big hit on such a hot day! We stopped by Dairy Palace and got pictures with Kevin's Dad, Whitey, earlier in the day. A patron at the ice cream shop even offered us his ice cream!\"\n\nAs an extra-personal touch, McLeod changed dresses for the reception at Tuscany Falls, coming out in her mother's wedding dress—alterations by Sara's Tailoring.\n\n\"I'm so thrilled that I did it!\" she told Patch. \"My mom was extremely surprised! The Bill Withers song 'Lovely Day' played as I came out wearing it. I pulled my mom on the dance floor. She was beaming. I will never forget that moment.\"\n\nIt was a wedding Tinley tailor-made, and one that turned the page in a love story with roots in their childhoods.\n\nMcLeod, now 43, met Oak Forest native Stepien decades earlier. McLeod first spotted him at a concert at the Markham Park District.\n\n\"...It’s kind of the cliché thing people say, I saw him from across the room, I thought he was a really cute guy,\" she recalled. \"One of the girls I went to school with was talking to him, and I was jealous.\"\n\nThey didn't meet that night, but eventually chatted at another concert later. But it took some time for their stars to align. \n\n\"Timing was just never right,\" McLeod said. \"We never dated, but we always had a crush on one another when we were younger. I was married once before, but Steve was just a very good friend, I loved him dearly.\"\n\nIt became clear over time that they had feelings for one another, but they never entertained them. McLeod dated and eventually married someone else.\n\nYears later, Stepien was chatting with a friend about affairs of the heart, when Melissa's name surfaced. \n\n\"She was the one who got away,\" he said. \n\nHe sent her a text to reconnect, but she was newly engaged at the time and told him as much (though she admits now his message gave her butterflies). \n\nTheir paths diverged. Six or seven years later, they reconnected at a mutual friend's party. Shortly afterward, McLeod and her husband separated and eventually divorced. Stepien had never married.\n\n\"I think timing was never right until then,\" she said. \n\nStepien can still remember their first \"real\" date of their adulthood courtship: June 26, 2021. \n\n\"We’ve been together ever since,\" he said. \n\nThough he had grown up in Oak Forest and attended Oak Forest High School, he was happy to indulge Melissa's vision of a Tinley-centric celebration. He jokingly calls her \"The Queen of Tinley.\"\n\n\"I know she’s so super-Tinley,\" he said, laughing. \"She loves Tinley Park.\"\n\n"},

The first major battle of the Civil War occurred in Virginia, the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas), which occurred in July 1861. It was a Confederate victory. Other early but lesser-known battles also occurred in areas close to Herndon, including the Battle of Balls Bluff in October 1861, which occurred in the Leesburg area and was also a Confederate victory. The Battle of Dranesville occurred in December 1861 in the Dranesville area, near the intersection of what is now Leesburg Pike (Route 7) and Georgetown Pike (Route 193). That was a Union victory. \n\nHowever, sandwiched in between the Battles of Bull Run and Balls Bluff was a little-known incident that occurred at Lowes Island in September of 1861. \n\nLowe’s Island sits along the Potomac River, at the eastern corner of Loudoun County, bordered by Fairfax County. It is located five miles north of the town of Herndon. At that time, in 1861, the Potomac River acted as an unofficial boundary line between Union and Confederate forces. The Confederates encamped in Leesburg and Centreville. Union forces, that had crossed part of the Potomac in Northern Virginia to help protect Washington, D.C., encamped in the Langley area. One mission of the Union forces was to secure the fords along the Potomac. \n\nIn the meanwhile, the secession of Virginia prompted some local Confederate-supporting residents of Dranesville and Herndon to form a Home Guard, a volunteer local militia to help protect the homeland. According to Charles Preston Poland Jr., who wrote, \"Dunbarton, Dranesville, Virginia:\"\n\n“The Confederate sympathy of the Dranesville citizenry was due to in large part to the institution of slavery which was well-established in the area before the eighteenth century.” \n\nIn the diary of a local Methodist minister, he noted that the people of the Dranesville area had voted for the Ordinance of Secession, \"almost unanimous – 107 to 4.” \n\nOne of the men who voted to support the Union was Benjamin Bready, older brother of Herndon’s future first mayor, Isaiah Bready. He was a farmer whose family came to the Herndon area from Pennsylvania in the 1850s. Other Unionists who lived in the area were Daniel Borden, Dennis Ormsby, Henry Bishop, Henry Biggs, Nelson Voorhees, and Mine[o]r Crippen. \n\nVoorhees was also a farmer. His family came from New York and moved to the Dranesville area in 1851. Once asked to join the Confederate militia, he fled to Washington. Later, he went back to New York for about a year. Crippen was a farmer as well, and came to the Dranesville area from New York. His descendants would stay in the Herndon area, later living on Pine Street. One of his descendents operated a furniture store on Station Street, and another later became Herndon’s first Fire Chief in circa 1920. \n\nIn his article, Dranesville: A Troubled Town, Ryan Quint said, \n\nSome of the locals who were part of the Confederate Home Guard included William Day, John T. Day, John B. Farr, Thomas Gunnell, and Philip Carper. The Day brothers were both doctors who lived next to each other on Leesburg Pike in the Dranesville area. John Day served as Herndon’s doctor. \n\nNathaniel Hanna of Herndon was a Unionist, whose family was from New York. However, he joined the Home Guard out of peer pressure. He lived in a small house at what is now 681 Monroe St., (now home to \n\n), along with his wife, Catherine “Kitty” Kitchen Hanna and their young son. \n\nSomeone else who tried to skirt the line and not upset either side was Charles W. Coleman, who operated a store and public house along Leesburg Pike, across from the Day brothers’ homes. The Coleman family was a very prominent family, having lived in the area for almost 140 years. One of Charles’s ancestors had built the first house in what is now Herndon (in the area behind the current Herndon Middle School), presumably in the 1770s. Charles’s father, who died in January 1861, had opened a tavern in the Dranesville area along Sugarland Run. It was so popular in the mid-1700s that George Washington was known to stop there several times, according to Washington’s personal ledger. \n\nCharles W. Coleman married into the Farr family, making him the son-in-law of John B. Farr. There was also a relationship between the Coleman and the Gunnell families, due to Charles’s paternal Uncle, Samuel Coleman, marrying Sarah Gunnell. John Gunnell was Sarah’s brother and was a wealthy land owner of hundreds of acres; he also owned 23 enslaved people. John Gunnell and his brother, Richard Henry Gunnell, were both leading figures in Dranesville. They lived near each other and helped to muster soldiers and procure provisions for the Confederates. \n\nMembers of the Home Guard harassed Unionists who lived in the area. Ryan T. Quint, who wrote the book, \"Dranesville, A Northern Virginia Town in the Crossfire of Forgotten Battle,\" described some of those harassing incidents. \n\nDaniel Borden recalled that John T. Day had warned him that if Borden went to Washington to join Lincoln’s army, then Day would burn his property and massacre his family. Borden was later arrested by the Home Guard for the crime of being a Unionist. The Home Guard group included the Day brothers and John B. Farr. After Borden was released, he fled to Washington. Another Unionist, Dennis Ormsby, said that William Day had threatened to hang him. According to Unionist Henry Bishop, the Home Guard made it their business to hunt and prosecute Union men. \n\nUnionist Nelson Voorhees recalled that he had once heard John Day say that if Day had his way, he would kill all the damned Yankee sons of bitches in the country because they were all abolitionists. \n\nWhen Bishop was arrested, he was taken to Charles W. Coleman’s store, which had become a headquarters for the Rebel troops. Coleman later admitted to feeding Confederates at his store but, according to Quint, Coleman had later rhetorically asked, “What would have been the consequence had I refused?” \n\nIn Kitty Kitchen Hanna’s memoir, \"Reminiscences of an Oldest Inhabitant,\" written by Virginia Carter Castleman, Kitty recalled that her Unionist husband, Nathaniel, told her that he joined the Home Guard, but he added, “I must tell you, though, that as soon as ever they ask me to fight, I’m off, ‘cause I won’t fight against the Union.” \n\nKitty described: \n\nIt was later that Hanna joined the Union Army. At one point, Hanna left for Washington, temporarily leaving his wife and mother-in-law in Herndon. Kitty later recalled that one night a group of riders that she described as “militia,” with their guns and bayonets, banged on her door, looking for Nathaniel. After a few minutes they left, but Kitty said she was so terrified that she later stayed at a neighbor’s house. \n\nHome Guardsmen roamed around the nearby woods of Dranesville with weapons, looking for Union men. And the local Unionists were always being watched and pressured. Needless to say, many of the Unionists around the Dranesville area feared for their lives. \n\nThat brings us to August of 1861. A unit from the 34th New York Infantry had made its way south to help protect Washington. They controlled about 17 miles of the Potomac riverfront on the north side, and were tasked to guard the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal. Just across the river was the unknown land of Virginia, which they were eager to see. They had frequently sent unofficial forging parties across the river to Lowe’s Island. McCarty and Ann Lowe lived on the island and were furious at the Union soldiers who took food and horses from their property. Out of frustration, McCarty Lowe traveled to Dranesville and reported what was happening to three Confederate soldiers who had been patrolling the south side of the river, Captains Gardner, Harvey, and Miller. \n\nThe officers created a plan to intercept the Federal soldiers on one of their foraging expeditions, but they needed help, so they called on the Dranesville Home Guard. They gathered about a dozen men. \n\nIn the meantime, on Sept. 16, Union New York Captain Wells Sponable, received orders to obtain as much information as possible about the Confederates who were understood to be stationed at Dranesville. The mission was to be a quick reconnaissance, so Sponable took a small patrol of about 12 soldiers to cross the Potomac River, which included Pvt. Oliver Darling, Pvt. Robert Gracey, and Cpls. Christian Zugg and Cyrus Kellogg. Some of those soldiers also intended to obtain some corn from Lowe’s Island while there. \n\nSponable took the lead in a single file, with Darling and Gracey behind him, and the others further back, bringing up the rear. When close to the cornfield Sponable heard someone give a command to fire and then the air exploded with a volley of gunfire. Sponable dropped to the ground to take cover and returned fire with his revolver. Both Darling and Gracey were hit, laying on the ground, appearing to be dead. \n\nSponable ran out of ammunition and decided to run back to the Potomac. He swam as the rebels continued to take shots at him. He made it back to the Maryland side. Zugg had been hit in the cheek but made a quick retreat to the river. He stayed in the river and kept just his mouth and nostrils out of the water for about three hours until he was rescued. However, as it ended up, the two privates, Darling and Gracey were not dead after all. \n\nGracey was shot in is shoulder. The bullet ricocheted and broke a rib and then exited his back. There are conflicting reports on whether Darling was already dead. However, Quint wrote: \n\nBut Mr. Lowe was not finished with Gracey. Holding a pistol, he walked up to Gracey as he lay on the ground and shot him twice. One of the bullets went through Gracey and another lodged in his lung. Both Gracey and Kellogg were taken prisoner, back to Charles Coleman’s house. Kellogg was sent to Richmond as a prisoner of war. Gracey stayed at Coleman’s house for about two weeks where he was tended to by Coleman. While there, both Doctors Day saw him but they reportedly refused him treatment. \n\nThomas Coleman, William Day, and Stephen Farr were known to have later gone back out to the ambush site. They emptied Darling’s pockets of money and letters, and stripped his body naked. Day gave some of Darling’s clothes to his enslaved people. \n\nBack at Coleman’s house, Gracey paid a man named Jimmy to go back out to where the ambush occurred to bury Darling’s body. Jimmy apparently did a quick job of the burial and did not bury him very deep. As a result, the body was later discovered by hogs, who then ate it.\n\nBy October, Gracey was transferred to the Fairfax County Court House and was put in a hospital, where he was given doses of opium. Gracey was able to escape by putting some of his saved opium into his guards’ coffee, putting them to sleep. It took him three days, but under the cover of darkness Gracey finally made it back to the Potomac River and to the encampment of the 34th New York. \n\nIn November, three fugitive enslaved people who had been enslaved by Eliza Coleman (Charles and Thomas’s mother) fled behind Union lines and walked into the federal camp at Langley and described what they had witnessed the men of the Home Guard doing in Dranesville. They also specifically reported on the Lowe’s Island ambush incident, as they had witnessed William Day returning to Dranesville with Darling’s clothing in hand. They also knew which enslaved people the clothing had been given to. One of the witnesses, Caroline Jackson, named 14 men who had participated in the ambush. The federals gathered the names and decided to apprehend the Dranesville men. Union Col. George D. Bayard, a commander of a cavalry regiment, was ordered to arrest the accused men. \n\nBayard and his men entered Dranesville on the morning of Nov. 27. His men kicked in several doors of homes throughout Dranesville and arrested six men: William Day, John Day, Charles Coleman, Richard Gunnell, John DeBell, and John Farr. They were unable to initially find Philip Carper and Thomas Coleman. Those two had heard that the federals were coming to Dranesville. They and a few others hid in the woods and fired their guns on the federals. However, they were eventually captured. Thomas Coleman died in that exchange. He was buried in the cemetery at the Liberty Church of Dranesville (now the Dranesville United Methodist Church). The others were sent to Washington where they were locked up in the Old Capitol Prison at the corner of 1st and A streets northeast. \n\nIn addition to the testimony of Caroline Jackson, there was also the testimony of other Unionists who went to Washington to report what had been going on in Dranesville. Additionally, Union detectives were sent to Dranesville to investigate the charges against the imprisoned Dranesville men. While in prison, Philip Carper wrote to his sister, warning her to be careful as to what she said to the investigators, asking her not to tell anyone what she knew about the men who were involved in “the fight on the river.” \n\nA special military commission was set up to determine the fate of those who had been arrested for the crimes they were accused of committing. Some of the captives claimed their innocence. For instance, Charles W. Coleman made a plea for his innocence based on his exemplary conduct, and the fact that he had never taken up arms against the United States. He also made a hardship argument, saying he had a wife, three small children, and a sick sister and her children, all of whom depended on him. He wrote many letters asking for an explanation for his arrest, even to Secretary of State William Seward, asking that Seward allow him to take an oath of allegiance to the United States. \n\nDr. William Day claimed he had nothing to do with the ambush at Lowe’s Island. He also said he served as the surgeon on the staff of a Virginia regiment at Manassas, and had provided medical support to both Union and Confederate soldiers, but no evidence could be found to corroborate that.\n\nKitty Kitchen Hanna recalled: \n\nWhile in prison, the Day brothers could hear what they thought were gallows being constructed. According to Quint, John Day “prayed often and loud upon his knees to be spared such a fate.” \n\nMany of these men spent months in prison. The imprisonment situation was complicated for several reasons. They were arrested by the military and were technically in custody of the War Department, much like prisoners of war. And yet, they were civilians, and so they were also considered to be political prisoners. Also, according to Poland, “A significant factor in the delay of release of Charles Coleman and others was the transferring of supervision of political prisons and prisoners of war from the State Department to the Department of War.” \n\nThe Dranesville men continued to languish in prison. Eventually, Seward’s secretary wrote to Washington’s Provost Marshall about Charles Coleman, requesting more information and suggesting that, “unless there are well-founded reasons to the contrary, the prisoner may be released upon the usual conditions.” And those usual conditions typically consisted of the prisoners taking an oath of allegiance to the United States, and agreeing not to give aid and comfort to the Confederates. By March 1862, the special commission was ready to meet to start their proceedings. Sewards’ secretary suggested that it would be preferable for the commission to dispose of the cases of the Dranesville men as soon as possible. \n\nQuint explained that the seven men who were being held in the Old Capitol Prison had been charged with various things such as, “murdering and robbing Federal soldiers at Lowe’s Island, VA,” and, “aiding and comforting the insurgents and oppressing Union men.” On March 21, 36 pages of testimony were made against William Day. Needing more time to deliberate about William Day’s case, the commission sent him back to the Old Capitol Prison. Three days later they heard cases against Charles, George and Richard Coleman, John Day, and James and John Farr. All were released except Charles Coleman and John Day. The next day, John DeBell and Richard Coleman were released. \n\nA few days later, the commission heard the case on Philip Carper, who stated he knew nothing about the Lowes’s Island ambush or who participated in it, saying he was at home with his mother at the time. But Carper also claimed he had joined the Confederate army back in September, and any action he would have taken were taken as a soldier, most likely stated at an effort to get released on a prisoner exchange. Again, as the commission deliberated Carper’s case, they sent him back to the Old Capitol Prison. \n\nBy the end of March, all the Dranesville cases had been heard. By April, the commission had still refused to release Carper and William Day, due to the serious charges against them. \n\nOn June 4, 1862, a Justice of the Peace who lived in Washington, John S. Hollingshead, wrote to the Assistant Secretary of War. Hollingshead asked that John Day and Charles Coleman be released after taking the oath of allegiance. Regarding William Day, however, Hollingshead suggested that Day’s fate be left to Hollingsworth, saying that Day would also be willing to take the oath, and that a $20,000 bond would be posted to assure Day would fulfill all his allegiant obligations. That letter helped move things along, and John Day and Charles Coleman were soon released. \n\nAlthough the War Department was very suspicious of William Day and Philip Carper’s claims of having served with the Confederate army, the War Department ultimately considered them to be prisoners of war and decided to process them through the prisoner exchange program. By the end of July 1862, Carper and William Day had been released and the government ended its case against the men of Dranesville.\n\nThe Lowe’s Island incident was a precursor to the Battle of Dranesville, which would occur three months later, where civilians and soldiers would once again collide, this time involving about 9,000 soldiers. But that is a story left for another day.\n\n"},

Authorities believe her killer created the wound and left the knife near her body to make it appear as if Eaton ended her life after becoming distraught with the death of her infant child.\n\nLittle Hazel died of smothering. Her body was found wrapped inside several blankets on her mother's bed. As for Maggio, he was the infant's father, but had no relationship at all with his child.\n\nDuring Friday's cross-examination of King, Maggio's defense lawyer Michael Clancy acknowledged to the courtroom that his own client \"for the most part disowned\" Hazel during her brief life.\n\nAfter going the first nine months of 2020 without talking to one another, Maggio and Eaton rekindled their dormant romance one month before the double murder, according to testimony. Maggio and Eaton worked together in Joliet at the Amazon plant. He was a paramedic there and she was a regular associate, Maggio told Lockport police detectives during his five-hour-long interview with King and Lockport Police Cmdr. John Arizzi four days after the double murders.\n\nAccording to testimony, as Maggio's fiancée and his two small girls were sleeping at their Crestwood condominium on the night of Sept. 20, 2020, Maggio made the 30-minute drive in the middle of the night to have sex with Eaton in the living room of her Lockport apartment. Eaton's two daughters, baby Hazel and 11-year-old Jessica, were both asleep when Maggio showed up.\n\nOn the night of Maggio's rendezvous with Eaton, Sept. 20, 2020, according to Friday's trial testimony, Maggio left his smartphone back in Crestwood. His fiancée, who was already asleep, had no idea Maggio sneaked out of their condo.\n\nMaggio stayed at Eaton's place in Lockport for about two hours and then drove back to Crestwood during the early hours of the morning. \n\nSuddenly, less than two weeks later, Eaton and her youngest daughter were dead inside the Lockport apartment house on Hamilton Street, while Jessica was unharmed.\n\nOn the night of the Lockport murders, Maggio's smartphone also remained in Crestwood, King informed the jury on Friday.\n\nOne of the reasons the Lockport detectives made Maggio a prime focus of their double murder probe was due to his lack of emotion and his lack of interest in learning more details about his daughter's death and the death of Ashtin.\n\nKing called Maggio and told him over the phone that Hazel was dead. At no point did Maggio ask the detective during the phone call about Hazel's mother, who was also dead.\n\nLockport's detectives later learned that Maggio did not break the news of Hazel's death to his own father, who was at his house. The father and son also had a good relationship, according to the trial testimony. After the death notification phone call ended, Maggio returned to his couch and watched more television, according to prior testimony. As the night went on, Maggio did not talk about Hazel's death with anyone, and he didn't ask anyone about the Ashtin.\n\n\"Like I was upset, I felt nauseous, and I just sat there,\" Maggio told the detectives during his Oct. 6, 2020 interrogation. \"I didn't want to talk to nobody. I felt sick.\"\n\nMaggio maintained he first learned of Ashtin's death the next day from some friends.\n\nAt the time of Maggio's interview at the Lockport police station, four days after the killings, the idea of arranging a funeral for Hazel had not even crossed his mind, Maggio told the pair of detectives. They also grilled him about the fact that he chose not to attend the memorial vigil held for Hazel.\n\n\"Do you have any pictures of her?\" King inquired, referring to Maggio's infant daughter.\n\n\"No,\" he replied.\n\nWhen pressed for his own theory about what happened to Hazel, Maggio suggested that it had to be an accidental fatality. He does not believe Ashtin harmed their child.\n\n\"I could not see that,\" Maggio offered. \"It would have to be an accident.\"\n\nDuring Friday's questioning from Maggio's defense lawyer, King acknowledged that Maggio was extremely cooperative with the Lockport police during their 5-hour-long interrogation. Maggio signed papers authorizing King and Arizzi to download the contents of his smartphone. He also signed paperwork allowing them to obtain a DNA buccal sample from his mouth.\n\n\"It's good you talked to us,\" Arizzi told Maggio. \"We'd hate to see your DNA pop up on something. That would suck.\"\n\nA common police tactic, which is perfectly legal, is to lie to a criminal suspect to gauge their reaction or response. The Lockport detectives took this approach with Maggio. They wondered if he was showing a genuine lack of interest in learning any details about the deaths of his infant daughter and the child's mother because he already knew what had happened and had been there when they died.\n\nSeveral hours into the October 2020 interrogation, King brings up the name of Jessica Eaton. The sixth-grade student, who was not harmed, found her mother's body on the kitchen floor. Jessica ran out her apartment screaming for help. Her grandparents came over and found Hazel also was dead. \n\n\"So, what do you think happened to Jessica?\" King inquired.\n\n\"What?\" Maggio responded. \"Is she alive?\"\n\n\"No, she is not,\" King lied to him. \"But she's not your daughter.\"\n\n\"What happened to her?\" Maggio asked. \"I don't know what to think about any of this.\n\n\"What happened to Jess?\" Maggio repeated. \n\n\"Probably someone did something to her,\" one of the detectives replied. \n\n\"What happened?\" Maggio inquired again.\n\n\"I don't know. We want to know happened,\" King replied.\n\nThe detectives told Maggio that his reaction to the news of Jess's death was the first and only time he showed any emotion and curiosity about the case.\n\n\"I'm not telling you you're lying,\" King told him. \"Do I think you did something to Jess, not at all. Not even a little bit.\"\n\nBefore the interrogation ended and Maggio was allowed to go home, Arizzi told Maggio that they just got word from Jessica's father that Jessica had not died after all. However, Maggio is told that he is not to share this information with anybody, including his father and his fiancée. The detectives warn Maggio this information needs to be kept silent for the safety of the victims' family because Lockport police still didn't know whether someone was out there trying to harm the family.\n\nMaggio's double murder trial enters its second week on Monday. The jury was told to report to the courthouse shortly before noon because Will County Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak is obligated to attend a Monday morning ceremony inside the Will County Courthouse for a newly appointed judge. \n\n"},
{"title": "40th Anniversary Of A Dream Realized: Brick Township's Hospital", "description": "It started with a community conversation in the 1960s. Today, Ocean University Medical Center has grown beyond the founders' dreams. ", "link": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/brick/40th-anniversary-dream-realized-brick-townships-hospital", "article": "BRICK, NJ — In July 1984, a dream that had been nearly 20 years in the making was realized with the opening of Brick Hospital. \n\nThe Brick Hospital Association, which had spent more than a dozen years raising money to build the hospital, celebrated that achievement with a large grand opening topped off by fireworks. \n\nOn Saturday, the hospital celebrating 40 years of being in operation with a family event reminiscent of the annual summer Brick Hospital Fair that helped raise funds to build the hospital. There were no fireworks, but hospital staff and management were on hand to highlight all the ways the hospital has grown since it began treating patients in 1984. \n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" Alan Cohen, a Brick Township community leader and one of the founders of the hospital, said in an Asbury Park Press article days after the grand opening. \n\nThe real beginning was community conversations in the early 1960s, as the Garden State Parkway began to bring more and more permanent residents to the area. Cohen, who for years operated Mr. Alan's Florist, led multiple fundraising drives. There was the annual Brick Hospital Association ball in every fall, at one point named the Starlight Ball. Every summer for 16 years, the Brick Hospital Fair drew thousands to ride carnival rides and play games in the area behind Brick Plaza that now is occupied by the AT&T store, Smashburger, Red Robin and Tre and Rosalita's. \n\nThere were numerous other efforts to raise funds to build Brick Hospital, and it truly was a community effort. In a letter to the editor published in the Asbury Park Press on July 31, 1970, Mrs. Thomas Lanteri, publicity chairman of the Brick Township Hospital Fund, thanked a group of kids who raised $14 for the fund by holding a yard sale of toys and other items. \n\nThe hospital foundation purchased a 30-acre parcel off Maple Avenue between Burnt Tavern and Herbertsville roads in 1970 for $45,000 from Harry and Kathryn Limroth. An Asbury Park Press report from October 1969, when the impending purchase was announced, said the hope had been to locate the hospital south of the Laurelton traffic circle (long-since replaced by the intersection of Routes 88, 70 and Princeton Avenue) due to concerns about traffic even then. Land prices were cost-prohibitive: Parcels south of Laurelton Circle that were large enough to accommodate the hospital cost nearly $300,000, organizers told the Press. \n\nThe efforts to build the hospital hit a number of bumps in the 1970s, including a lengthy legal battle when the owners of Paul Kimball Hospital in Lakewood (now Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus) fought to block it, saying the area did not need another hospital. The fight over the certificate of need took a number of turns, with even Gov. Brendan T. Byrne getting involved. A law passed to help Brick ultimately was rejected by the New Jersey Supreme Court. \n\nIn addition, the state Department of Environmental Protection deemed the soil conditions at Maple Avenue as not suitable for the proposed four-story hospital, a March 1982 Asbury Park Press report said.\n\nThe Maple Avenue parcel was sold to Brick Township for $1, and the hospital association purchased the 32-acre site on Jack Martin Boulevard — land records show it was carved out from a much-larger piece of land that had once been poultry farms — for $180,000, according to land records. \n\nAt that time, the Brick Hospital Association merged with Point Pleasant Hospital to create the Northern Ocean Hospital System, and on July 4, 1982, ground was broken for Brick Hospital, which was to operate as a satellite of Point Pleasant Hospital. \n\nThe $31.4 million facility opened with 120 beds and 200 doctors, and accepted its first patient on July 9, 1984. \n\nThe hospital has grown and changed dramatically in the 40 years since, just as the area has changed. Brick Hospital and Point Pleasant Hospital merged with Jersey Shore Medical Center in 1997 to create Meridian Health, and in 2001, Point Pleasant Hospital shut down. Condominiums now take up part of its former site, and a satellite 24/7 emergency care center, Ocean Care Center, now operates in Point Pleasant, next to the OB Diner. \n\nBrick Hospital, which became Ocean Medical Center and, in 2021, \n\n when it achieved status as a teaching hospital, now has more than 300 beds and 800 providers and is part of the Hackensack Meridian Health Network. \n\nHopes for bigger and better things at the hospital have been realized, as it now is seen as a regional destination for orthopedic, cardiovascular, cancer, stroke, and other care services, and holds numerous disease-specific designations in joint replacement, stroke, colon cancer surgery and other areas.\n\nOcean University Medical Center also is home to the Johnson Rehabilitation Institute, a 40-bed facility \"that offers all-encompassing inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services,\" the news release said, \"and the recently established Dr. Robert H. and Mary Ellen Harris Heart and Vascular Center, one of the state’s most advanced centers for heart and vascular diagnosis and treatment.\"\n\n\"As Brick Township and our surrounding towns have grown rapidly over these past few decades, Ocean University Medical Center has always progressively served the needs of our region,\" Mayor Lisa Crate said in a news release from the hospital. \"We are very fortunate to have the highly recognized Ocean University Medical Center as part of our neighborhood fabric.\"\n\n\"Excellence remains our standard, and patient-centered care is our priority,\" said Robert C. Garrett, chief executive officer of Hackensack Meridian Health. \"Exceptional hospital leadership and the continued dedication of the Ocean University Medical Center team have led us to this proud moment and reaffirms our commitment to the responsibility we have as an organization to the communities we serve across the state.\"\n\n\"This milestone reminds us of the strong focus we have on our continued mission – providing high-quality, comprehensive care,\" said Frank Citara, president and chief hospital executive of Ocean University Medical Center. \"I am incredibly proud of our transformative work in the community and am confident our upward trajectory will yield even more innovative services in the years to come.\"\n\n"},

{"title": "The History Behind Libertyville's 'Devil's Gate'", "description": "A local history buff shares her thoughts on the urban legend and how it originated.\r\n", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/libertyville/history-behind-libertyvilles-devils-gate-2", "article": "LIBERTYVILLE, IL — If you've lived in Libertyville at some point over the past 40 years, you may have heard of \"The Gate\" or \"Devil's Gate.\" \n\nAs legend has it, and that legend definitely varies depending on who is telling it, someone — either a camp counselor at a summer camp, a principal at a girl's finishing school or a ward attendant at an asylum — went crazy and killed four people on the property behind a stone gate along North River Road.\n\nWhile local historians say there is no evidence of a mass killing ever occurring on the property, there was a \"home for children\" on the property from 1925 to 1936. \n\nThe Katherine Kreigh Budd Memorial Home for Children, which served as a summer camp for orphans from St. Mary's Orphanage in Chicago, was located on 200 acres along the Des Plaines River — and includes a portion of what is now the Independence Grove Forest Preserve. The camp had housing for 165 children and there was also a swimming pool, playground and outdoor chapel, according to a 2012 presentation by \n\nIn the late 1930s, the property served as an annual retreat location for Episcopal clergymen and was leased to Boy Scouts of America for a few years. The Catholic Youth Organization purchased the land in 1939, and over the next 40 years, it served as a summer camp. \n\nIn 1982, the Lake County Forest Preserve purchased the main part of the camp land and all the buildings were torn down. But while much of the property's structures were razed, the gate still stands.\n\nThe tale of the gate likely originated at some point in the mid-1980s, Jenny Barry, local history librarian for the Cook Memorial Public Library District, told Patch during an interview in 2020. \n\n\"The Forest Preserve had demolished the buildings and what remained was the big stone gate on a drive that leads to nowhere and a few other remnants such as fire hydrants that can be seen off the bike path today,\" she said. \n\nAmong the most popular tales told around campfires and whispered among children around this time of year include that of a principal who had a mental breakdown at a girl's finishing school, St. Francis School For Girls, in the early 1950s. He killed four students and then put their heads on the metal posts of \"The Gate,\" according to the historical society presentation. \n\nOther stories include the gate once serving as an entrance to a summer camp where a camp counselor OR a mad man who escaped from an asylum OR a nun killed four children while in bed, Barry said. Lastly, some have said that gate was an entrance to an asylum where a ward attendant went insane and killed four patients. \n\n\"I have found no evidence that any of the variations on the legend are true in regard to the killings,\" Barry said. \n\nFor those telling and retelling the urban legend surrounding the school, the tale goes on: the killer was caught and, presumably, imprisoned or executed, but the trauma shattered the school and it closed. But the building stood empty for years in the clearing beyond the trees, according to a 2012 presentation on The Gate by the local historical society. \n\nAfter talk of the school being haunted and an overall sense from the community that the sight of the old building was too unbearable, a movement started to tear it down and turn the area into a nature preserve.\n\nAccording to the legend, this push for the preserve was a great success. And soon, it seemed, all traces of St. Francis School for Girls were gone from the site. \n\nAs some tales told about Devil's Gate go, the new preserve was called Independence Grove as a tribute to the survivors who, once the school was destroyed, were free from the reminders of the mass killing. In reality, though, Barry said the preserve is called Independence Grove because that was an early name used in place of Libertyville.\n\nAnd, the area where the gate is called St. Francis Woods and is just north of Independence Grove, Barry said. \n\nOver the years, many scary sightings — or legends of scary sightings — have been reported in the area of the gate and on the property, which is located at a bend along North River Road and west of Trenton Road. Some have said they've seen blood dripping from iron posts, a headless nun roaming the woods, the ghost of a small boy spotted staring out from behind the iron posts and other apparitions, according to past presentations from the Libertyville-Mundelein Historical Society regarding The Gate. \n\nThose living in homes near the gate say they've heard eerie screams and mysterious sounds, or spotted figures wearing 1930s-era clothing either in their homes or in nearby farm fields.\n\nAmong the spookiest of tales comes from those who say on midnight on Halloween, which is rumored to be the anniversary of the murders, phantom heads appear on the fence posts.\n\nAs legend has it, curious teens have been seen decapitated children's heads on the gates posts after shining a flashlight on it at night.

The intensive care and rehabilitation unit treats patients with thermal, chemical, contact, electrical and radiation injuries from around Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.\n\nEquipped to handle both adult and pediatric cases, the center is one of just 35 such facilities in the nation. \n\n\"I've worked at three burn units, and this unit has the strongest burn survivor support system and community of anywhere I've ever been,\" said Dr. Cliff Sheckter, the center's Medical Director. \"Staff here is incredible and you need a lot of staff for a burn center, but it’s not just about having the right people. It’s also having the resources it takes to recover these patients.\"\n\nSheckter said two recent cases illustrated the Burn Center's top-tier ability, successfully saving the lives of a man who suffered burns over 85 percent of his body in a steam explosion, and another who had severe burns and trauma injuries from major car crash.\n\n\"Burn injuries are dangerous on multiple levels, psychologically and physically, particularly when you have an extremely large burn,\" he added. \"You cannot live without 85 percent of your skin — you will die from an infection.\"\n\nAccording to the county, the renovations are on track for completion in 2026, upping capacity to 14 beds, and keeping the burn unit, operating room, clinic, physical therapy space, and other support services in the same area of the hospital.\n\nLearn more about the project below:\n\n"},

Consequently the carousel will be closed for some period of time for repairs before reopening.\"\n\nSteussi reminded that the ride was originally designed as a traveling carousel and had to be assembled and taken down. \n\nDuring its many years in Mitchell Park it has never been disassembled, since being placed in the carousel pavilion at opening, Steussi said.\n\n\"We have a world renowned carousel specialist who is coming to Greenport to evaluate repairs in the coming weeks, at that time we will be able to better gauge needed work,\" the mayor said, adding: \"The time it will require to do the work is going to be significant and even in the best case scenario a reopening by Christmas will take extraordinary work and coordination with multiple trades.\"\n\nIn 2016, as new \n\n, former Greenport Village Mayor David Kapell was thanked by Gail Horton of the carousel committee for his vision in creating Mitchell Park and bringing the carousel to Greenport from Riverhead. \n\nThe carousel had stood for years on the former Grumman property in Calverton and was enjoyed by scores of employees at Grumman's annual picnic,\n\nThe carousel is a 1920 Herschell-Spillman wooden carousel, and it was a gift to Greenport that brought joy to the community, including a sea of elementary school students who, under the direction of former Greenport Schools Superintendent Charles Kozora, wrote letters to Mr. Grumman asking for the carousel to be brought to the village, Kapell said.\n\n\"It was a great community effort,\" Kapell said, of the move. The carousel, stored at Stidd Systems in Greenport, was assembled in just a few hours. And then, he said, with electric needed, resident Bill Swiskey was called over on a Sunday to \"jury rig\" the carousel and get it running for its first go-round in the village.\n\nThe carousel, Kapell said at the event in 2016, symbolizes the past and future hope of Greenport.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing. Eventually, every one of these kids that have ridden the carousel will have kids and bring them right back here. It sows the seeds for the future of the village.\"\n\nSince the carousel first illuminated the night in the village, Kapell estimated in 2016 that approximately 2 million riders had hopped onto a bedecked wooden horse and taken their turn reaching for the brass ring.\n\nRemembering his own childhood spent on the Central Park carousel, Kapell said the beautiful painted horses, lights and music create indelible forever memories imprinted on hearts and souls. The carousel, he said, \"is a fantasy, in a kid's mind. It's magical.\"\n\nWhen the carousel first arrived in Greenport, an array of residents turned out to help, including current Trustee Julia Robins. Over the years, the carousel was stored not just at Stidd but also at Barstow's Shipyard and at the corner of Front Street, Horton said.\n\nWhen he was elected in 1994, Kapell said his first aim was to dismantle the village's controversy-mired police department and then focus on the blighted Mitchell property, which was \"in foreclosure, with a bank that was also in foreclosure.\"\n\nThe parcel, he said, held promise.\n\n\"There was amazing possibility,\" Kapell said. And with the Grumman property for sale, and all eyes on the future of that parcel, Kapell said his laser focus was solely on bringing the carousel to Greenport as a gem in the crown of all Mitchell Park could possibly become.\n\nHow it evolved, he said, was \"serendipitous.\"\n\nRemembering the early days, Robins said blankets were brought to carry all pieces together for assembly; she then described how the carousel is physically constructed. Originally, she said, the carousel was used as part of a traveling circus and erected in a field at every stop.\n\nHorton said, simply, that those early days, when passion and vision brought a dream to life in the form of a carousel at the heart of the village, were unforgettable.\n\n\"It was magical,\" she said.\n\n"},

He then scheduled an in-person appointment at a Chase Bank branch in Plantation, Florida, for Aug. 26, 2022. \n\nHe flew to Florida on Aug. 25 and met with a co-conspirator who impersonated the Pleasant Hill victim and used the victim's stolen identifying information.

Prosecutors said McCormick continued to make electronic transfers and cash withdrawals from five other bank branches until he drained the victim's account.

They asked us to come out,” Gibbons told Patch. “We started picking up stuff right away,”\n\nGibbons and Larry Eissler III, of the show \n\n now streaming on \n\n, roamed the basement and attic of the building.\n\n“Nobody has ever investigated the Lyric before. We’re hearing a little boy in the building that was not caught on our equipment,” Gibbons said. “We’re actually hearing it.” \n\nThe Lyric opened at 12952 S. Western Ave. in 1917 adjacent to the Grand Opera House in Blue Island’s bustling entertainment center. The first talkie shown at the Lyric was “The Terror” on April 1, 1929, according to the theater’s bio. Eventually the theater became a mecca for Southsiders looking to watch a movie in swankier surroundings.\n\nA fire on Valentine’s Day 1960, during a matinee showing of the movie “Cash McCall,” starring James Garner and Natalie Wood, destroyed the theater. Fortunately, everyone was able to escape the blaze uninjured. The Lyric rose from the ashes and was rebuilt. It remained open until the late 1980s, when it closed again. \n\nOther attempts were made to reopen the theater but the Lyric remained dormant during the 21st century until two longtime Blue Island families, the Garetto's and Cantelo's, restored and reopened The Lyric in 2022. Nearly every inch of the theater has been renovated. There's a magnificent 29-foot wide, 17-foot tall screen, along with state-of-the-art audio and visual features. The Lyric also offers live shows and two large banquet facilities for weddings and other functions. \n\n“There’s a lot going on in Blue Island,” Gibbons said. “We did The Forge and found evidence of a presenting ghost. We also did Natural Law where we found a mischievous spirit, nothling malevolent. It’s always in the basement area of these places.”\n\nAudience members will be treated to a full audio video presentation centered around recent findings at The Lyric, as well as other haunted places from Chicago to Kentucky where Gibbons has conducted investigations. In addition to the presentation, Eissler will offer a Paranormal 101 crash course, where audience members can come up to stage and use the equipment where paranormal activity has been detected.\n\nDoors to the SpookEasy open at 7:30 p.m. with the presentation starting at 8 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 31, at the Lyric Theatre, 12952 S. Western Ave., Blue Island. Tickets are $20 and can be purchased online at Graveside Paranormal. This is an age 21 and over event. The Lyric offers a full bar and concessions.

", "link": "https://patch.com/illinois/oaklawn/oak-lawn-brothers-horror-flick-set-beverly-lands-streaming-deal", "article": "OAK LAWN, IL — A pair of Oak Lawn brothers – Carmelo Chimera, 38, and Nick, 22 – have made one of the most terrifying Halloween flicks dropping this month on streaming services worldwide. \n\nTheir movie, \n\n described as the “most terrifying single-shot exorcism film ever made,” tells the story of a young wife and mother, Anna, who gets possessed by a demon, and her husband David’s desperate attempts to help her.\n\nReminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1948 psychological thriller “Rope,” or the World War I epic “1917,” the Chimera brothers’ “Name The Demon” uses a single shot to follow the characters around as they race to save Anna. \n\n“It starts when they turn on the camera and ends when the battery dies,” Chimera said. “The battery is a ticking time bomb. It has the timestamp as if it were someone’s home video recording.”\n\nThe story takes place in 2019, a year after the Vatican announced that exorcisms had quadrupled worldwide. The movie is presented as found footage, much like the “Blair Witch Project.” \n\n“When I heard about the exorcisms, I wanted to revisit one of my favorite movies, ‘The Exorcist,’” Chimera said. “It’s important because we wanted to connect the film to a real life event. Given that it’s Halloween it’s creepy and real.”\n\nThis isn’t the Chimera brothers’ first collaboration in horror, who wrote and co-directed “Sin Eater,” about a woman who stumbles upon a town harboring a dark secret. \n\nThey wrote the script for “Name the Demon” and co-directed the movie in 2022, which was shot in seven days in a home in Beverly. Their friend, Beverly resident Jaison Chahwala, produced the film. \n\nChahwala and Chimera bonded over their love of Spider-Man when Chahwala randomly walked into Chimera’s LaGrange comic book ship, where a No. 1 edition of Spider-Man turned up. At the time, Chahwala was working on a Spider-Man book, \n\n based on his correspondence and phone conversations with Steve Ditko, the artist who created Spider-Man. \n\n“There have been hundreds of stories based on real-life accounts of priests who perform exorcisms,” said Chahwala, who grew up in Auburn. “We brought in one of the most famous horror special events artists, Joe Castro. He’s done over 30 horror movies in the past 25 years, mostly indies.”\n\nAfter the film was finished, the team spent the next year shopping the film around to major distributors. One of the lead producers based out of Colorado had a relationship with \n\n, a distribution company specializing in securing streaming deals for independent films. \n\n“We had some difficulty securing a deal because we’re a bunch of nobodies,” Chahwala said. “We’re a very DIY crew. They watched the movie and liked it. They said we could make some serious money off this.”\n\n“Name the Demon” was shot with a $50,000 budget. Chimera said they’ve already made it back in pre-release.\n\n“The thing about horror that is important from a business perspective, is that unlike other genres where sales are driven by the name value of actors and fame of the talent. In horror, audiences care if the movie is scary, not about the actors,” Chimera said. “You can make a horror move on a micro-budget, but still make big budget profits.”\n\nThe movie stars Danny Bohnen (“The Last Son,” “Murder at Yellowstone City”) and Jessie Nerud (”Artie and Paul,” “Sin Eater”). \n\n\"Name the Demon\" has been shown in 11 film festivals, including the \n\n in Cincinnati, \n\n, and the \n\n where it won an award.\n\nSome may remember Carmelo’s store, Chimera Comics on 95th Street in Oak Lawn, which he gave away in 2019 in a contest. He still has his day job as a corporate transactional attorney. Nick is in law school. Both brothers are graduates of Brother Rice High School. \n\nThey’re already at work on their next horror film, “Director’s Cut.”\n\n“It’s a low budget horror movie where the director decides to kill his cast for real,” Chimera said.\n\n“Name the Demon” released worldwide on \n\n, \n\n, \n\n, \n\n, \n\n and other streaming services on Oct. 4, also known as Demon Day.\n\n"},

Previous honorees included Prince, who received the first award in 2015, Al Edwards, Merle Levine, Pauline Smith, Sarah Benjamin, and current Southold Town Board members Brian Mealy and Dr. Anne Smith.\n\nRecently, the community was saddened to learn that a beloved familiar face would soon be \n\n on the North Fork: Demeroto announced that she would be stepping down in October — with the search on for her replacement, the board said.\n\nDemeroto wrote a letter to the public, stating that she was leaving with a heavy heart \"to focus my time and attention on my family. As some of you know, it has been a challenging year for my family, but we are filled with hope as we embark on the next phase of our journey.\"\n\nShe added that it has been her honor to serve CAST and the Southold Town community since taking the helm in 2017.\n\n\"In the past seven years, I have led the organization through a global pandemic, a capital campaign and move to a new permanent home, 40-year high inflation, and an affordable housing crisis serving the most vulnerable in our community during a time of unprecedented need and exponential growth in demand for CAST’s essential services,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"I came to CAST with a vision to expand and enhance programs and services, to find CAST a permanent home, and create a first of its kind community resource center on the North Fork of Long Island.

However, we all understand that family comes first, and we wish her the best as she navigates these challenges. In 2016, When CAST began its last search for a new executive director, we had no idea that we would find someone with the skills, experience, vision and heart that Cathy embodies. It was immediately clear when she took the job that Cathy knew what CAST had to become: a first of its kind community resource center on the North Fork of Long Island.\"\n\nSokol said he has never worked with an executive \"with such a combination of skills, character, and heart. Beyond Cathy’s many accomplishments at CAST, she has made everyone who worked with her including the board and her staff better people. There is no doubt that CAST and the broader CAST community will miss Cathy, but the organization that she built will endure and continue to deliver the services conceived and implemented over the past seven years.\"\n\nAlthough Demeroto's last day is October 18, Sokol said that he has no doubt that her laughter and spirit will shine on at CAST.\n\nThe board has already started the process to find a suitable replacement, he said.\n\n\"I am optimistic that the good fortune that brought us Cathy in 2017 will still be with us as we seek a new executive director.

Administrators have pledged to propose more than $12 million in budget cuts in January.\n\nLast week, administrators issued a request for proposals for \"structural deficit reduction planning consulting services,\" specifically \"\n\n.\" \n\nSuperintendent Angel Turner said consultants will also be able to determine the most efficient bell schedules to reduce transportation costs, which administrators will be able to present to the board.\n\n\"This is not easy work by no means and my team and I are working extremely hard just really trying to sense-make and understand what it entails to really do this level of work,\" Turner said.\n\n\"When the consultant starts to work, they will have to hit the ground running, in a sense, to really take a lot of information that we are giving them, to be able to synthesize those and be able to come up with some options for us to really think through,\" she said.\n\nProposals are due Oct. 11, and board members plan to award the contract at their Oct. 28 meeting. The board is looking for firms that have had similar contracts in at least three other school districts. \n\nIn a statement, administrators defended spending money on an outside firm to recommend ways to spend less money as a good investment.\n\n\"This is about bringing a fresh set of eyes to ensure that we are looking at the very difficult yet necessary decisions from every angle,\" it said.\n\n\"It's not about avoiding responsibility but gaining additional support in bringing expertise and objectivity to an extremely complex, highly sensitive process.\"\n\nDistrict 65 Chief Financial Officer Tamara Mitchell said district officials are looking for firms with relevant or similar experience. \n\n\"It’s important to note that the school board is ultimately making the final decisions, the consultant is not making the final decision,\" Mitchell said. \"The school board is making those final decisions.\"\n\nSince it is an RFP, there is no requirement that the board goes with the lowest bidder, Mitchell said.\n\nBoard member Biz Lindsay-Ryan emphasized the need for an outsider to recommend a solution to the district's structural deficit. \n\n\"This person is going to need to make recommendations about cuts and so having an internal person making decisions about cutting either their own position or their colleague's positions is complicated,\" Lindsay-Ryan said. \n\n\"And so having an outside perspective gives us a chance to ensure that that can truly be a objective process,\" she said.\n\nIf \n\n worsens, a state takeover could result in the appointment of a financial oversight panel with the authority to make decisions about budgeting, staffing and resources. Such takeovers have occurred in school districts in North Chicago and East St. Louis, leading to significant restructuring of their budgets and operations.\n\nDistrict 65 board members have already decided to close one school. Earlier this year, they voted to shutter the Bessie Rhodes School of Global Studies, 3701 Davis St. in Skokie, following 2025-26 school year. Its closure will coincide with the opening of a new school in Evanston's 5th Ward.\n\nResident Spencer Stern said the financial issues in the district have been clear for more than a year, though he had been attacked for questioning the rosy financial projections with regard to the new school. He attributed the district's enrollment decline, which far outpaces other similar districts, with its \"uninnovative\" response to in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic. About 1,000 students departed the district from the start of the 2020-21 school year to the end of the 2021-22 school year. \n\n\"My feeling is, looking retrospectively back at this, that Superintendent [Devon] Horton and CFO Raphael Obafemi really perpetrated a fraud here on the citizens of Evanston,\" Stern said. \"And I think, from the perspective of the board, you guys did not do a well enough job of asking the tough questions in order to get at the crux of why this school ended up costing so much and why the \n\n ended up not saving the school as much.\"\n\nConstruction is currently underway for the new Foster School, with an estimated cost of more than $48 million. Plans had to be scaled down after the initial designs ran $25 million overbudget. \n\n\"The thing that is just very disheartening to me is, due to the combination of the fiscal mismanagement around the Fifth Ward school and students leaving, there will be significant cuts in resources, programs, etc., that I think will more adversely affect the minority students that you guys purport to focus on serving,\" he said. \"That's the thing that is going to be, I feel, the unfortunate legacy of this.\"\n\n"},

Another new tenant, Dogtopia – a provider of dog daycare, boarding and spa services – is coming soon, LMC stated.\n\nThe shopping center draws more than 2.6 million visits annually, according to real-time traffic data from Placer.ai.\n\n“As one of the country’s most desirable anchor tenants, Target will add vibrancy and economic activity both to West Orange Plaza and the surrounding community,” LMC vice president of leasing Sidney Singer said.\n\n“At a time when available shopping center space is limited for new construction, West Orange Plaza’s enviable demographics and ability to accommodate Target’s needs in an existing former Kmart space created the ideal leasing scenario,” Singer added.\n\nWhen news of Target’s impending arrival \n\n, West Orange residents and others living in the area hit the internet to share their opinions about the news. \n\n“The enhanced property value should result in increased tax revenue,” a commenter opined on a previous \n\n.\n\n“Do you know how many stores have opened and closed in that area?” another reader countered. “Pretty much all of them.”\n\nOther West Orange community members shared their views on our \n\n, providing “an entire spectrum of opinions from love to hate,” according to one commenter.\n\nThe replies included:\n\n Yet more West Orange residents and community members weighed in via the town’s original social media announcement.\n\n“We are super excited for this all to happen,” the owners of Frank's Pizza and Restaurant \n\n, adding that the business will remain in the same spot when Target arrives.\n\nOther comments included:\n\n \n\n"},

Portocarrero told Patch that the baby was under the care of his father in his East Haven home.\n\nPortocarrero, 32, is the sole provider for her children, both boys, Angel and his 3-year-old brother, she said. Their father watches the boys at times when she’s at work. He is unemployed, she said. She is a store manager in Stamford, working 40 hours plus a week. \n\n“The truth of the matter is I am a hard-working single mom and the provider for my children. My life is work and the kids. Their dad doesn’t give me a penny. The only help from him is watching the kids in his mother's house. I left my children with the person I thought I could trust.”\n\nPatch is not releasing the identity of the father, as no charges have been filed. Police said Wednesday that there is still an active investigation.\n\nSunday night, at around 9 p.m., firefighters and police went to a Redfield Avenue address for a pediatric emergency call. When they got there, first responders found the seven-month-old infant \"unresponsive after being left unattended in a bathtub,\" police said. \n\n“He left both my children unattended,” Portocarrero told Patch. “I don’t know for how long, but his negligence and irresponsibility is the reason my son is not here now. I want justice for my son.” \n\nMedics from the East Haven Fire Department attempted life-saving measures before the infant was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital. \n\nPortocarrero was on her way to East Haven from her Stamford job when she got a call from the Angel’s aunt. \n\n“It was 9:05. She told me to hurry to the house because something happened to the baby. She told me she heard screaming and saw ambulances and immediately called me. I was already on my way from work and rushing in that direction,” Portocarrero said. “Then, she called back and said to just race to the hospital. She told me (that the children’s grandmother) was doing CPR on him. She said, ‘He was in the bathtub.’” \n\nPortocarrero was terrified. \n\nWhen she got to Yale New Haven Hospital’s York Street pediatric emergency department, she “heard the sirens” and realized she’d gotten there first. \n\n“They brought me into the room. They were working on trying to resuscitate him. It felt like an eternity. Then, this guy is kneeling in front of me and he says, ‘We have to call it. Time of death is 9:56 p.m.,’” she said, her voice quaking between deep sobs. \n\n\"Despite the best efforts of the East Haven Fire Department, AMR ambulance medics, and hospital staff, the child tragically died,” police said Sunday night. \n\nPortocarrero said that the “fact that Angel’s father didn’t even have the decency to get into the ambulance with his son” hurt deeply. “His sister went with my baby, and I’m grateful for that,” she said. “I don’t understand how he left them alone. I would never leave them alone. Never.” \n\nHer loss, the pain, and the grief she’s feeling, she will not display around her three-year-old son. He was a witness. \n\n“In front of him, I can’t grieve. I cannot cry. I have to be strong.”\n\n“I just paid rent and have $70 to my name,” she said. She lives in Ansonia. “I am literally the main provider for my children. But my managers and my staff are incredible people. Everyone is really supportive. They all know my kids. They love my children. So this isn’t a loss just for me. My family, friends, and co-workers are all grieving.”\n\nAnd while her managers have told her to take all the time she needs before returning to work, she does not have the money to bury her baby. \n\nHer niece Leslie Baca set up a \n\n on Portocarrero’s behalf to help pay for “memorials and after-life services, as well as any financial help to both my aunt and her other son.” \n\nWhile she was at the hospital in pieces, she was asked about organ donation.\n\n“This was at first the hardest decision to make. If my son’s life was cut short, agreeing to donate his organs, so no other mother has to go through what I’m going through? I said yes. It was so hard, but it was so important. His life has meaning.”\n\nWednesday, East Haven police Capt. Joseph M. Murgo shared the latest on the case.\n\n“Preliminary investigation indicates that Angel was in the care of family members in East Haven at the time of the incident. It should be noted that Angel’s primary residence was in Ansonia with his mother who was not on scene during this incident and was not involved during this terribly tragic event. This case remains under investigation, and further updates will be provided as they become available. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Angel’s family and will remain in contact with them during this incredibly difficult process.”\n\n"},

The spirit of the event is so positive, and it is a beautiful piece of New York City.\"\n\nJerry Brandehoff, who co-founded the event with Banikarim three years ago, said in the beginning they had no idea what they were doing but held on to hope that the idea would catch on. \n\nWhen around 500 people showed up the first year, the organizers knew they had something special and have continued to build on it. Last year, about 700 people attended.\n\n\"I think people come back because they want to partake in and celebrate a sense of community in this incredible city we call home. The energy on the day is contagious, and you see old friends and make new ones,\" Brandehoff told Patch. \"It's really special.\"\n\nBrandehoff said some of his favorite dishes over the years include an olive oil cake to celebrate Italy that a friend had brought and a 5-foot-long sub that his friend, Gerald, has brought the last two years. \n\n\"I've heard many people say it's their favorite day in New York and one of the best things they've participated in. I think it really fosters a sense of community and helps build lasting relationships,\" Brandehoff added. \n\nNeighbor Ellie Ahmadi said she was a guest at a table last year and thought it was a clever idea and wanted to get involved. \n\n\"In today's environment, there seems to be an increasing disconnect and division. Face-to-face interactions allow us to see each other as individuals,\" she said. \"An event like this brings us out of our homes, we put away our phones and maybe for one day we forget about our differences and notice how much we have in common. \n\nAhmadi brought homemade organic hummus to the event and said her table was \"amazing\" with homemade focaccia, several warm and cold dishes, and baked goods to try. \n\n\"By the end of the event, as I was walking the block, several tables offered me food since there was so much left over.\"\n\nThe Longest Table event has been replicated in Harlem, Midtown, Kansas City, Mo., California and even Paris, France by using an online toolkit Banikarim created. \n\n\"When we started, we wanted to have hundreds of events across the city on the same day, but we have moved on to having a potluck for 7,000 people across the Brooklyn Bridge,\" Banikarim said. \n\nBrandehoff took a step further, saying, \"How cool would it be if we could do a national version, bringing hundreds of thousands of folks into the streets of their towns to celebrate together.\"\n\n"},

There were tens of thousands of pieces of evidence seized, and each one had to be logged and inventoried and forensically examined before it could then be determined if it has any relation, not only to these victims, but also to any of the other victims that haven't yet been identified. It's a long, tedious process from the legal perspective.\"\n\nFrom an emotional point of view, however, Macedonio said he was \"sympathetic. Victoria was not even born when the first of these alleged crimes took place. In her mind, she's asking, 'Why is my iPad being taken?' From the prosecution's standpoint, how do they know that Rex didn't use the iPad in Victoria's room?\"\n\nMacedonio maintained that while he never wants to undermine what the Gilgo Beach victims and their families have gone through, Ellerup and her children are \"collateral damage, as a result of Rex's alleged actions. Their lives are destroyed forever.\"\n\nWhat's been returned so far in terms of possessions, Macedonio said, are items that were seized under the second search warrant — gift cards, a birthday card her grandfather sent Victoria, some scratch-off Lottery tickets. \"Once they were analyzed, it was realized that they have nothing to do with the case,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ellerup and the kids have seen their entire personal lives ransacked, Macedonio said. \"Everything was taken.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Heuermann was arrested in July, 2023, still, he and his client have \"no more knowledge now than we had. Everything we know about the case was obtained in the bail application document and what was stated by the DA's office.\" \n\nThey have no other information other than what's been released to the public, he said. \"None, zero.\"\n\nDespite the length of time since the arrest, Michael Brown, Heuermann's attorney, \"still doesn't have enough discovery to even think about a trial date,\" Macedonio said. \n\nHe anticipated that a trial could begin about a year from now, with motions and hearings in between.\n\n\"It's a long time for his family to go through all these emotions, until they finally have closure, one way or another,\" Macedonio said.\n\nAsking how Ellerup and the kids were faring, Macedonio said: \"There are really no words to describe it. Every day, their lives are put on hold. We don't know what the outcome will be. Asa doesn't want to believe Rex is capable of these crimes. Who would?\"\n\nEllerup, Victoria and Christopher are not working, Macedonio said. \"Who's hiring them? Their lives have stopped.\" \n\nHe added that many speculate that Ellerup is financially stable due to any deal she may have had with Peacock. \"Whatever that money is, it doesn't support you for the rest of your lives,\" Macedonio said. \n\nThe DA's office did not immediately return a request for comment about the potential trial date or the returned personal possessions.\n\nThe second search of Heuermann's home \n\nay, Macedonio told Patch.\n\nThe exhaustive search spanned five days as a swarm of investigators were back at Heuermann's home — and Macedonio spoke with Patch about the toll the week had taken on his family.\n\n\"This family has been though the most traumatic year imaginable,\" said Macedonio. \"Whether Rex is found innocent or guilty — if Rex get acquitted, their lives are destroyed, because he's still known as a serial killer. If he's found guilty, they're always going to be known as the as wife and children of a serial killer.\"\n\nVictoria, Heuermann's daughter, 27, was working for her father when he was arrested, Macedonio said. \"Who's hiring her now?\"\n\nThe family, he said, has seen their life in turmoil since July, 2023,when Heuermann was arrested.\n\nAt the time, investigators conducted the first extensive 12-day search of their home. \"Everything was just thrown in when the police left, floor to ceiling,\" Macedonio said. \"They literally had a 2-foot path to get to the door.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you take everything out of a house, from the attic to the basement, they're not putting it all back neatly back in closets.\"\n\nEllerup and her son were in South Carolina when authorities \n\n earlier this year, and Victoria, still in New York, went with Macedonio to retrieve her car, he said.\n\nThe new search has left the family with questions, Macedonio said. \"They went through this a year ago, now it's, 'Here we go again,'\" he said. \"We have no idea why, or what they are looking for — what they missed.\"\n\nWhen asked what the search was for, a representative for Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney's office responded: \"As District Attorney Ray Tierney has previously stated, the work of the Gilgo Beach homicide task force is continuing. We do not comment on investigative steps while ongoing.\"\n\nMichael Brown, Heuermann's attorney, also did not comment after repeated requests.\n\nIn 2023, the search of the Heuermann property \n\n and included the home, an excavator on the grounds, and an Amityville storage facility.\n\nRecently, the DA's office said, of an ongoing search in areas of Suffolk County, including Manorville, Calverton and Southampton: \"DA Tierney has repeatedly publicly stated that the task force would continue to investigate additional murders beyond Gilgo.\"\n\nThis June, Heuermann was s\n\n in the deaths of two additional women, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, according to a superceding bail application released to the press before the proceedings — bringing the total number of his alleged victims to six.\n\nIn July 2023, Heuermann was \n\n Melissa Barthelemy, Megan\n\nWaterman and Amber Costello, whose remains were found along Ocean Parkway in 2010.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nA total of 11 sets of remains were found in the Gilgo Beach murders, which rocked Long Island. The remains included that of a toddler and an Asian male.\n\nHeuermann was also charged with the \n\n, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, in January. New DNA evidence helped connect Heuermann to all four of the deaths, said Tierney, who is prosecuting the case.\n\nHeuermann was charged with second-degree murder, an A-1 violent felony, in the death of Brainard-Barnes on July 9, 2007. Heuermann has also pleaded not guilty to that charge.\n\nHeuermann \n\n for a routine appearance where \"voluminous amounts\" of discovery were turned over to the defense, according to Tierney — and at the time, the DA said it was \"safe to say\" that he might be considered a suspect in the death of a seventh woman.\n\nWhen asked if Heuermann may be \n\n, whose remains were found in Manorville and near Cedar Beach, Tierney said: \"It's safe to say he would be a suspect, yes.\"\n\nNew details were released recently about an \n\n found in the same areas as those associated with the Gilgo Beach killings, Tierney said — and law enforcement is appealing to the public to identify the individual and bring closure to his or her family.\n\n"},

As someone with a passion for vintage clothes, Shaw quickly fell in love with thrifting and said the experience inspired him to start a business of his own.\n\n“We went out to the store and I don’t know, I just fell in love with it,” Shaw said. “I’m a broke teen, so I wanted to find a way to make money, and I loved the idea of thrifting and re-selling.”\n\nFrom there, \n\n was born. \n\nWhile Shaw initially started YNG Thrifts with a friend, he said he currently runs the business on his own. With stores set up across \n\n, Instagram, and \n\n, Shaw uses YNG Thrifts to sell gently used, thrifted, and vintage clothing to interested buyers.\n\n“A lot of my clothes come from thrift stores, Facebook Marketplace, Goodwill bins — places like that,” Shaw said. “The listing process comes with looking up each item and finding comparable prices online. From there it’s just posting and hopefully, someone will buy it.”\n\nAccording to Shaw, people can buy products from him through online ordering, direct messages, or in-person appointments at his home, where Shaw keeps products stored.\n\nThough YNG Thrifts sells plenty of vintage t-shirts, jackets, and sweatshirts, the store also offers unique products such as rings, wallets, and even \n\n. \n\nSince establishing the business in 2023, Shaw said he’s been focused on expanding YNG Thrifts and his customer base — something that isn't always easy to do while in high school. \n\n“The hardest part [of running the business] is really the multitasking,” Shaw said. “Because while I’m doing this work, I’m also in my junior year of high school, which is the hardest year. So it’s just being able to post and source, while, at the same time, focusing on school.”\n\nThough Shaw runs YNG Thrifts on his own, it doesn’t mean he’s without any help when it comes to business operations. \n\nLuke’s mom, Jen Shaw, said that watching Luke run the business has been a bonding opportunity for them, and something she's enjoyed helping him with. \n\nWhether it's providing business advice or driving him to different stores, Jen said she and her son have become closer than ever since starting the business months ago. \n\nIn June 2024, \n\n, where Luke was able to talk with customers and community members face-to-face. \n\n“For me, as a mom, it’s a teaching thing. You know?” Jen said. “Like responsibility, and organization, and becoming more business savvy — it’s about learning how to speak to people, which kids today don’t necessarily know how to do.”\n\n“And I think Luke’s always been a little bit older and wiser beyond his years,” Jen continued. “But this has definitely shown him how to talk to people of all ages and different types.” \n\nFor Luke, running YNG Thrifts has been an opportunity to both learn and help others. \n\nThough he primarily acquires products through shopping and online marketplaces, Shaw also buys items from friends and fellow students who want to get rid of clothes. \n\nLast year, for example, Shaw was able to purchase products from graduating seniors who wanted to sell their clothes before going to college. \n\nThroughout the past months, Shaw said running the store has provided him with both business experience and new relationships. \n\n“One of the best parts [of running the business] is the experience of getting to know new people,” Luke said. “I’m always meeting people from different backgrounds and that type of stuff. It’s really all just a learning process.”\n\nTo learn more about YNG Thrifts, you can \n\n.\n\n"},

There is no good reason to take this decision out of their hands and impose arbitrary limits on their choices,\" said Doug Purington, who directs publicity and membership for the Ravinia Neighbors Association. \n\n\"The status quo is an affront to the intelligence of our community, it signals a lack of trust in voter wisdom, and it is unsustainable,\" Purington said in a statement.\n\nHighland Park Forward, a grassroots political action committee, has led the charge in favor of the amendment, with members arguing that the law is outdated and unfairly limits voter choice. \n\n“Everyone knows this antiquated law needs to be fixed,” said HP Forward Executive Board Member Jim Lederer, the owner of Bluegrass restaurant in west Highland Park. “The voters elected Hoobler knowing that he held a liquor license, and they likely picked him because of his business experience.”\n\nLed by Irwin Bernstein, a member of the city's Business and Economic Development Advisory Group, HP Forward's only reported funding so far has come from the Citizens for Jeff Hoobler committee. \n\n“Residents from all corners of the community are telling us they want the Highland Park City Council to update its antiquated liquor licensing law so it no longer limits who can serve in elected office,” said Bernstein, who pledged that the new committee will support candidates and issues to promote a more vibrant business environment and a more open city government.\n\n"},

It's a tradition that goes back to 2013.\n\nRecently, though, the district \n\n from before 2022. \n\nAt Wednesday's board meeting, a member defended the decision, pointing to a policy committee meeting from August 2023. However, no one during that session suggested wiping away most of the online files. \n\nResident Linda Burke, who has publicly supported the board on most issues, recommended \"flipping the switch\" to bring the old records back online. \n\n\"I'm suggesting the board take care to avoid even the appearance of holding back information that the public is entitled to,\" Burke told the board. \"I'm concerned with the erasure of a vast amount of FOIA material. I don't know the rationale for it. I'm not a lawyer, but it doesn't have a good look to it.\"\n\nKim Notaro, a Hinsdale resident who staunchly backs the board, also questioned the decision. She said she attended the August 2023 policy committee meeting.\n\n\"We ask for an awful lot of data, and I do kind of want it back,” she said. \"It would be nice if that (information) was forward-facing for everyone and not necessarily have it in the FOIA log. That would help a lot.\"\n\nFor her part, member Peggy James defended what happened. She noted the policy committee, which she heads, discussed the public records request process. During that meeting, she suggested creating archives for the records. \n\n\"The full committee agreed and provided guidance to the administration to review the FOIA log for continuous improvement opportunities and to archive older requests,\" James said. \n\nA review of the August 2023 recording shows that most of the discussion involved which information to black out in records. \n\nAt one point, James said she was open to the district finding ways to streamline the process. She also noted a staffer said the requests go back to 2013. \n\n\"Maybe there's an archive possibility of information if that's an appropriate method,\" she said. \n\nThen-member Kay Gallo said decisions related to the public records process do not need to come back to the board. \n\nAt the time, James did not indicate that she meant older record requests should be removed from the website. \n\nIn a recent email to Patch, District 86 spokesman Alex Mayster wrote, \"In August of 2023, we developed a procedure for the FOIA log that includes displaying responses from the present year, as well as two years prior.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's meeting, Yvonne Mayer, a board critic, said she filed a public records request for all FOIA log information before 2022. She said she expected to be denied, with the district likely labeling her request as \"unduly burdensome.\"\n\n\"That will be a damn shame if all you have to do is flip a switch and return everything back to the public FOIA log – public records that were requested by the public and now they're gone,\" Mayer said. \n\nIt remains a mystery who made the call to wipe away most of the archive.

Most parishioners can’t remember anyone else but Ed being there conducting the choir or playing the organ.\n\nZelnis’s life as a musician began as a child growing up at 73rd Street and Winchester Avenue in Murray Park, now part of Englewood. His family wasn’t particularly musical. They liked music but nobody played anything. \n\n“Mother thought I showed an aptitude and she took me to the only music teacher within walking distance of our house,” Zelnis recalled. “She lied about my age because I was only five and he wouldn’t take anybody under seven.”\n\nThe teacher, Howard Kelly, was a jazz trumpeter. Zelnis studied piano with Kelly until high school. \n\n“He taught music theory and the nuts and bolts aside from teaching piano,” he said. “So I was conducting and arranging by high school.”\n\nHis music teacher at Quigley South High School (now St. Rita), Cecil Gorey, became his next mentor. At that point, Zelnis was conducting and arranging all the musicals at Quigley South. \n\n“Between my junior and senior year Gorey got the music director job at Christ the King,” Zelnis said. “He brought me along as an organist.”\n\nFor the next five years Zelnis was the Gorey's organist at Christ the King. When Gorey moved to New York City to become a personal manager for musicians, Zelnis took over running the music ministry at Christ the King.\n\nThe job wasn’t as easy as it looked. One challenge was that Vatican II threw out all of the old style Latin and Catholic music.\n\n“People were having trouble adjusting to the new music. We couldn’t play the old stuff as it was almost banned,” Zelnis said. “I was constantly trying to find music to play.”\n\nOver the years, more and more Catholic contemporary composers have emerged. “We have a full repertoire. Now we can do the old banned stuff as well as the newer music. We play everything.”\n\nDuring his very first Christmas Eve midnight mass at Christ the King, a young woman was home for the holidays visiting her parents who lived across the street from the church. It was a tradition for her to walk across the street and sing a solo during the midnight mass. Her name was Janis Knox. \n\n“She sang Ava Maria while I played along with her,” Zelnis said. “She liked my playing. She started calling me when she got jobs singing at weddings. Then I started singing with her and then we started dating for 20 years.”\n\nThey worked together at the Goodman Theater and Steppenwolf. In addition to singing at Chicago Lyric Opera, Ed and Janis also performed at small clubs in Chicago with a six-piece band. Today Knox is the main cantor and soloist at Christ the King. \n\nRemember Cecil Gorey? Gorey started managing singer and actress Eartha Kitt (she played Cat Woman on “Batman”). Toward the end of Zelnis’s college years at Northwestern University where he earned a music degree, Gorey brought the young student on as Kitt’s music director. \n\n“From 1979 through 1980, I was her music director,” Zelnis recalled. “I used to travel with her to clubs in New York, San Francisco, Miami, Brazil.”\n\nOne gig he remembers playing for Kitt was at the 90th anniversary gala for Carnegie Hall. \n\n“They has a big party in a gigantic tent,” Zelnis said. “That particular gig I got to conduct the Count Basie Orchestra. The program featured a whole bill of Broadway stars.” \n\nThese days the couple, who married in 2002, live in Park Ridge where Ed directs the Park Ridge Chorale community chorus. They still make the trek to the South Side to conduct the choir and sing at Christ the King, which they consider home. \n\nOn Friday, Oct. 11, Zelnis will present a free hour-long concert for the community to mark his half century at Christ the King, 9235 S. Hamilton Ave., Chicago. The concert starts at 7 p.m., and features special guests (and Ed’s wife) Janis Knox, the Ed Zelnis Trio and Janis Knox and the Zelnis Strings. A reception will immediately follow.\n\n “The concert will be a thank you to the parish for being part of my life,” Zelnis said. It won’t be church or classical music. We’re going to do fun stuff, classic rock, jazz and some show tunes.”\n\n"},

We have a couple of weeks off, it would be nice to do something.' So I contacted the team.\"\n\nFrom there, he said, scores of those eager to help ran with the idea. \"It just snowballed,\" he said.\n\nErin Hardy in Southold, he said, \"was a big part of this\" taking to social media to share lists of what was needed, including baby wipes, non-perishable food, diapers, sleeping bags, camping equipment, blankets, tools, and more. \n\nWendy Zuhoski at Wendy's Deli has also been a \"tremendous force,\" and is still accepting donations through Friday at 2 p.m.\n\nAlong with Wendy's Deli some drop off points include Famous Footwear on Route 58 in Riverhead, Riverhead Building Supply, The North Fork Animal Welfare League, the North Fork Animal Hospital and Mattituck-Laurel Veterinary Hospital; they are collecting through Friday. \n\nOther teams on the racing circuit also came together, Ogiejko said; he is heading to Thompson Speedway Motorsports, CT Friday for a race — and to pick up even more boxes at a collection point there. \"The whole Whelan Tour company jumped onboard,\" Ogiejko said.\n\nThe huge boxes of donations will be packed into a 48-foot hauler and taken to North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, next week; the supplies will be distributed to those in areas of North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene, he said.\n\nIronically, Ogiejko said, the team was supposed to race at the North Wilkesboro Speedway, but due to the hurricane, that event was canceled – and the venue is now a drop-off point for supplies.\n\nOgiejko said he never knew how widely the initiative would blossom. \"I had no idea that it would get this big,\" he said. \"It's amazing.\"\n\nThe Long Ireland Beer Company had a supply drive Sunday; the team brought the race car out for the event.

Then there was the need for tools — equipment, chainsaws. And then, the water started subsiding. Then they needed body bags. It was terrible.\"\n\nThe despair was beyond imagination, he said.\n\nMost recently, the need has been for hats, gloves, blankets, work gloves, sleeping bags, camping supplies, propane heaters, lanterns, hand warmers shampoo, and body wash.\n\nOne campsite is opening up specifically for veterans left homeless by the hurricane, he said.\n\nHardy said she, too, has seen a huge outpouring of love from people wantiing to help.\n\n\"The 46 boys are racing this weekend in Thompson but I’m off, and willing to take any last minute donations,\" Hardy said. \"We're so thankful for the response so far. We live in one hell of a community.\"\n\nZuhoski said she first joined the effort when she saw Hardy's post and contacted her to see if she could help. \"I mentioned that we could be a drop-off point, and she thought that would be great,\" she said. \"So many people have jumped in to help.\"\n\nJernick Moving & Storage has even offered to drive their trucks down if there is an overflow, Zuhoski said. \"Many local businesses have been collecting for us — customers, social media followers and people as far as Stony Brook have been dropping things off,\" she said.\n\nZuhoski reminded that only new items are accepted at the deli and canned food must not have reached its expiration date.\n\nWatching as the donations pour in has been a life-changing experience, Ogiejko said. \"It restores your faith in humanity,\" he said. \"Everyone has been so volatile lately, so on edge. It's just nice to see that here, people are getting involved out of the goodness of their hearts.

It is located at 295 Talcottville Road, the local address for that stretch of Route 83. The building can accommodate as much as 15,000 square feet of commercial activity with 80 parking spaces, according to the listing on \n\n. It has sat vacant for several years. \n\nIt is the easternmost property owned by Toor along the 200 block of Route 83. His holdings also include, heading west, the current cannabis shop, the former Pancho Loco restaurant property, the former Lazy Liquor store and the strip plaza occupied by Pro Health Physicians (at 206 Talcottville Road). \n\nThe Pancho property at 218 Talcottville Road was demolished about a year ago, shortly after the restaurant closed, and the plan was to raze the liquor store and a small residential unit behind it right after and build a plaza measuring 20,500 square feet in their places.\n\nTrouble was, the project became mired in a paperwork nightmare that took until this month to resolve. For about the past six years, town officials thought the entire parcel sat in a strictly commercial zone, but, it turns out, that was a mistake created on the town land records when they were converted over to the current electronic system. A bit of research after a protest by an abutting property owner uncovered two separate zones that put the front two-thirds in a commercial zone and the back end of the property in a special residential zone, Vernon Economic Development Director Shaun Gately said.\n\nThe courts decided the most practical thing to do was to re-visit the regulatory process, since it was advertised erroneously, he added. According to town records, the appeal period for the project expired Wednesday. \n\nToor Told Patch that some materials abatement work is under way at the liquor store and the demolition will follow soon after. \n\nAs for the old Tux King, Toor said he will offer it as a short-term lease of about six months to begin with, but eventually wants to tear it down and replace it with a commercial building measuring about 20,000 square feet. \n\nIt sits on 2.75 acres, Toor said. \n\n\"A restaurant would be nice there,\" Toor said. \"We always need restaurants.\" Toor was quick to add that is just one concept for a building that could house a number of businesses. \n\nToor said he wants to finish the Pancho-Lazy Liquor property before turning to the tuxedo shop. \n\n"},

The battalion commander asked if it was someone in the mall or something else. Dispatch said the JCPenny store manager saw smoke through the store’s windows into the closed-off section of the mall. \n\nAs they drove to the scene, firefighters tried to clarify exactly where the smoke condition was. A dispatcher said no alarms appeared to be going off at the site. One firefighter wondered if the master box was active, saying it was probably down. The commander also asked if the smoke was voluminous. The dispatcher said they did not know, noting they were speaking with a member of the public.\n\nWhen firefighters arrived at the previous food court entrance, they reported seeing nothing obvious and could not access the building. The commander suggested the second wave of firefighters enter from the JCPenny side to see if they could spot fire or smoke. \n\n“We do have limited access to the building,” the battalion commander said. \n\nFirefighters accessed the area through JCPenny while the commander requested police to clear the building since it appeared people were setting fires inside.

The firefighters, they said, could lead the police inside. \n\nTwo officers were sent to the scene. \n\nLater, the fire commander reported finding no fire in the mall but did report fire extinguisher residue in the food court area. Firefighters began to clear and were sent to the McDonald’s Restaurant on Loudon Road for an alarm activation. \n\nBefore clearing the mall’s east side, firefighters requested fire dispatch tell police that garage doors appeared to have been jimmied open not far from the food court entrance, which might be how people were getting inside.\n\nAround 5:45 p.m., police cleared the building and began searching the site outside for possible suspects. They cleared the scene later.\n\nPolice have been to the mall several times in the last six months or so, issuing criminal trespass charges to teenagers and young adults from New Hampshire and Massachusetts after incidents in the abandoned buildings and parking lots.

Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and curtain is at 7 p.m.\n\nPenned by Glenn Reese, a longtime advisor to the Enfield Lamplighters theater group and a member of the Enfield Athletic Hall of Fame, \"The Girl with One Red Shoe\" is the story of Charlie Jones, an unassuming everyman who shares an apartment with his polar opposite yet best friend, Pete Strong. A dedicated (but not very talented) accountant by day, Charlie’s dream is to become a singer/songwriter like his idols in this madcap 1970s comedy. \n\nWhile Pete exhausts himself hitting the club scene, Charlie has been earnestly dating a single exhausting girl, Carol Steadman, since high school. He plans to marry her, make it as a musician, and live happily ever after.\n\nUnlike hardworking Charlie, Carol gets everything in life handed to her and Charlie is blissfully unaware of Carol’s true, opportunistic nature. Her spoiled side is the product of her overprotective parents, Ed and Mary, who go from calm to combustible whenever they don’t see eye to eye. \n\nWhen not trying to impress Carol’s family, Charlie often finds himself being bolstered by his quirky downstairs neighbor, Cookie Rubens. As sweet as her name, Cookie has the uncanny ability to both pop in at the most inopportune times and not quite hide her true feelings from Charlie. Her subtle hints are easy to miss, though, when her visits are accompanied by the building’s new, exotic and seriously-flamboyant superintendent.\n\nAlthough devastated by losing his job, Charlie holds strong to the plan by testing out his new songs at the same coffeehouse every Friday night to a lukewarm response. One week his usual set takes an unexpected turn towards stardom, when the ladies in the audience break into a swooning, clothes-tearing frenzy. Before he can fully process what has happened, Charlie returns to his apartment and impulsively misreads an interaction between Pete and Carol. As far as he can tell, his new adoring fans, dishonest roommate and jobless future make it nearly impossible to stick to any semblance of the plan. Against all odds, Pete and Cookie team up to help Charlie see things as they really are, and even help him find true happiness in the most unexpected of places. \n\n\"So like many, many guys in the 1970s, and I was one of them,\" Reese told Patch in a recent interview. \"The big draw back then was the singer/songwriters: Jim Croce, James Taylor, Harry Chapin, Cat Stevens. They had an acoustic guitar and you would sing along with the LP up in your bedroom. This is our protagonist, Charlie - an accountant by day, but an aspiring singer-songwriter during the evening.\n\n\"For some unknown reason, one day the women in the crowd go crazy over him, like Elvis crazy, because he sang a new song that he had never sung before. He's trying to figure out what's going on because now he's thinking, well, maybe I'm going to be a big superstar like my hero, John Denver, and I'm going to play in stadiums and things like that.\"\n\nReese said \"The Girl with One Red Shoe\" was actually the first full-length play he ever wrote. It was originally slated for production in early 2020, and had actually been cast and rehearsed for a month, but the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic brought a halt to those plans.\n\n\"What was initially going to be a two-week shutdown turned into a month, and eventually four and a half years,\" Reese said. Late last year, he proposed producing it to the Valley Rep artistic director, who presented it to the board and was granted approval. Of the eight actors appearing in the play, just one is a holdover from the original cast.\n\nTickets to \"The Girl with One Red Shoe\" are $20 general admission and $15 for seniors and students. They may be reserved by visiting \n\n or calling 860-810-6152. Tickets will also be available at the door.\n\n"},

None of the Board members present that evening, including Howard, raised any objection. Howard said \n\n and in a new interview below that she continues to support redistricting today.)\n\nAnd yet nearly every other school board candidate — and who did not receive Gonnelli's favor — has been critical of redistricting.\n\nRedistricting had nothing to do with his choice, the mayor stressed to Patch this week. Rather, it is the revolving door of superintendents that has been at the forefront of his mind when it comes to Secaucus schools.\n\n\"I never asked any candidate once about redistricting; I don't care if redistricting happens,\" said Gonnelli. \"All I care about is getting a new superintendent. That's where I'm putting all my effort and all my power.\"\n\n\"I just want it to be someone good; someone who knows about the town of Secaucus and who knows how Secaucus works,\" he said.\n\nIn June, acting Secaucus superintendent Charlie Voorhees seemed eager to return to his regular job as athletic director and Secaucus head football coach. \n\n\"I have a very good day job,\" he told Patch \n\n. \"I consider this my after-school job.\"\n\nGeller, Lyons and Howard all affirmed the mayor never brought up redistricting to them.\n\n\"He said nothing to me about redistricting, and has never brought it up to this day,\" Lyons said this week. \"He just said the board has been having some issues with leadership in the district — the superintendent leaving, the head of special (services) leaving and so on.\"\n\nHe is referring to Kerry Goldsack, director of special services (special education), who resigned in June. The position has still not been filled.\n\nLyons said \"someone else in the room\" (presumably a Secaucus councilperson) once asked for his views on redistricting, and Lyons gave an answer similar to what he said \n\n: \"That I could not give an opinion on it. I need to see more data. I think my answer frustrated the person who asked, but that's the truth.\"\n\n\"We never talked about it (redistricting). Our conversations were about my background and my general views on education,\" said Geller Thursday. \n\n\"Mayor Mike did not ask me anything about redistricting. It was not a conversation we had,\" said Howard. \"I’m not sure of the criteria that was used to pick the endorsements he chose.\"\n\nGonnelli says he asked Lyons to run after learning that he had been on the Jersey City school board for 10 years, and had recently moved to Secaucus. And Gonnelli said he asked Geller to run after learning about her background in special education (she's a speech pathologist in Jersey City public schools.)\n\nAfter town-wide backlash, the school board decided to table redistricting. But it will be brought up again for discussion in 2025.\n\nSpeaking to Patch Friday morning, Howard said she continues to support redistricting.\n\n\"I supported it (in January) and I support it now,\" she said. \"I think it would be a good thing for our schools because it would allow us to offer more educational opportunities for our kids. For example, we could offer a STEM program. Right now, it is very expensive to roll out a program such as STEM in two different elementary schools. So we are limited.\"\n\nAlso, Howard said she does not think it is right that all special-needs students are housed in Clarendon School.\n\n\"Right now, they are the only kids who need to re-district. So they can play with a kid in their neighborhood, but not go to school with that same kid. I think by housing only special needs in one school, we are highlighting things we shouldn't be highlighting.\"\n\n\"I feel it was rushed the way they tried to do it in January,\" she added.\n\n (Sept. 13)\n\n"},

He explained why the cause of restoring sports back in his old hometown, where he has not lived for more than 40 years, is so near and dear to his heart.\n\n\"One of the great things about Enfield is that I have so many incredible memories about growing up there, and so many of them revolve around sports,\" he said. \"When I think of 279 students on 17 athletic teams that don't have a chance to do that this school year - in no way would I ever be critical of the school board for cutting these sports. I understand it's crisis mode, I get it, but when Russ, Paul and Bob phoned and asked me to help, I said I'd do everything humanly possible to do.\"\n\nKing has successfully reached out to many of his numerous NFL contacts to aid in the fundraising campaign.

He has run close to 30 of the New Haven Road Races over the years, including the most recent event last month.\n\nMore than 5,000 runners participated in the 47th annual Faxon Law New Haven Road Race this past Labor Day.\n\nDolan, who has been a member of the board of directors for about 30 years, said the board is made up of volunteers who coordinate the event throughout the year.\n\n“The tasks that need to be completed throughout the year include elite athlete recruitment and accommodation,” Dolan said. “The race has been the 20K national championship for the past 18 years. As such, it attracts the country’s top distance runners that include past Olympians. There are a lot of details that going into putting on the race: painting the various mile markers on the course, setting up the 10 water stations, obtaining and distributing post-race food and drinks, securing adequate toilets, distributing bibs and shirts to the participants, and more.”\n\nIn this year’s race, the 2023 women’s 20K champion Keira D’Amato of Virginia successfully defended her title with a first-place finish of 1:06:25.\n\nColorado’s Hillary Bor, a 2016 U.S. Olympian in the steeplechase, additionally claimed victory in the men’s 20K with a time of 58:09. Bor’s performance not only secured him the title but also set a new American record for the 20K distance, according to officials.\n\nParticipants took on various race categories, including a 5K, 20K, Half Marathon, Half Marathon Relay, and Kids Fun Run. Highlights included Samuel Foti from New Haven winning the male category of the Kids Fun Run with a time of 3:05, and Addison Harkins from North Haven claiming the female slot with a time of 3:13.\n\nColin Slavin from Prospect, secured the male 5K win with a time of 15:31, while Courtney Kitchen of Milford took the female 5K title with a finish of 17:46.\n\nIn the Half Marathon, Benjamin Macdonald from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was the male lead with a time of 1:10:01, and Tabea Themann from Hamburg, Virginia, won the women’s category with a time of 1:18:11.\n\nDolan said some of the accomplishments he’s most proud of during his time with the board is “changing the race course to make the race more accessible to more spectators that helps to provide encouragement to the runners and the Green Initiative we have undertaken.”\n\n“Our efforts have included moving from plastic cups at the on-course water stations and finish to compostable cups, we have worked with local environmental groups to compost and recycle the waste that the event generates,” he said. “We continue to work to reduce the NHRR’s carbon footprint. The event raises a significant amount of money. We proudly donate approximately $20,000/year to local charities.\n\n“The NHRR is a family oriented event that promotes healthy living. I look forward to serving on its board and running the 20K for many more years.”\n\n"},

He also staged the crime scene to appear as if the distraught mother took her own life after accidentally suffocating her baby.\n\nAfter the jury verdicts were read, Clancy and a half-dozen relatives of Maggio were immediately escorted out of the Will County Courthouse by Will County Sheriff's deputies through a side door. Meanwhile, two of Lockport's lead detectives responsible for securing the arrest and conviction of Maggio remained outside the courthouse, receiving long hugs and warm regards from more than two dozen family and friends of Ashtin Eaton and baby Hazel.\n\nJoliet Patch's editor reached out to Lockport Police Chief Rich Harang for comment following Friday's jury verdict in the Oct. 2, 2020 slayings.\n\n\"First and foremost,\" Chief Harang began, \"I want to say our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of both Ashtin and baby Hazel. I know this entire process has been extremely painful for them and this was a terrible tragedy that should never have occurred.\"\n\nChief Harang went on to say: \"I want to thank my investigations team for their hard work and dedication on this case. They did a magnificent job. Without their passion for this profession, their professionalism in the way they handled this case and commitment to ensuring justice was brought on the person responsible, this case could not have been solved.\"\n\nAdditionally, Chief Harang noted: \"I want to thank the Illinois State Police and the Will County Sheriff's Office for their assistance along with the Will County State's Attorney's Office for their expertise and successful prosecution of this case. I commend the jury for finding Maggio guilty of the murder of both Ashtin and baby Hazel. These are very difficult cases in that they are extremely tragic for everyone involved.\"\n\nLockport Police Department Detective Jacob King oversaw the double murder investigation. King and Lockport Police Commander John Arizzi conducted the Oct. 6, 2020, \n\n, then 26 years old, which lasted five hours.\n\nThe Will County State's Attorney's Office prosecution team consisted of Christopher Koch, James Zanayad and Ashley Kwasneski. \n\n\"My daughter is finally going to have justice along with my granddaughter, finally, after four years, \" said Shirley Onderisin, 65, of Lockport, outside the Will County Courthouse during a Joliet Patch Facebook Live interview. \"We're so happy, not happy because they're gone, but finally, anyway, justice is served, and I want to thank the Lockport police. They were a terrific part of this. I put my trust in them a lot.\"\n\nJoliet Patch asked Hazel's grandmother how she felt coming back to the courthouse for a second day of jury deliberations. \n\nOn Thursday, the jury deliberated from noon to 10 p.m. without a unanimous decision.\n\n\"I was very worried, very worried,\" she replied. \"But the evidence was there. I did a lot of praying.\"\n\nAs far as Lockport's police detectives, \"They always kept in contact with me. And with them and the prosecution team, they were really good ... I did a lot of praying.\"\n\nMaggio's sentencing was set for late December. In addition to being represented by Chicago criminal defense attorney Michael Clancy, Maggio's defense team also included Margaret V. McQuaid of the Law Office of Margaret V. McQuaid.\n\n\"You know, he's going to suffer for a while, and I'm going to suffer until I die,\" Onderisin said. \"Because my babies will never be here with me again. But his dad can go visit him.\"\n\nRegarding having both her daughter and baby granddaughter murdered, \"Why? Why?\" Onderisin asked. \"It was so senseless. I mean, why did he do this? He could have been living a good life. We all could have been living a good life. Now he's got to sit in prison for the rest of his, and I don't have my babies...\" \n\n"},

The car exited directly behind another vehicle, and both turned left onto Storrs Street, heading north. Both vehicles were stopped at a red light at the directional at Storrs and Pleasant Street Extension. The driver of the car that caught the officer’s attention inside the garage was “frantically turning his head to the left as if to look in his mirrors,” the officer wrote. The driver then “suddenly” drove across the double yellow line, into the southbound travel lane, and “darted” onto Pleasant Street Extension, an affidavit said. \n\nThe officer activated their cruiser lights as the “vehicle rapidly pulled away” on Pleasant Street and the officer began to chase the vehicle, the report stated. The officer also informed dispatch of the chase. \n\nAt the intersection with State Street, the vehicle turned south, and the officer ended the pursuit. Later, they heard “a muffled bang,” and as they approached the State Street intersection, the officer saw the vehicle had crashed into a car in a parking lot near the intersection.\n\n“The vehicle was smoking,” the officer wrote, “and all the airbags had deployed.” \n\nThe officer exited the cruiser, found the 2014 Volkswagen Jetta unoccupied, and was told by a witness the driver ran toward Main Street.\n\nAnother officer radioed they were with a man a couple of blocks away on North Main Street. \n\nThe man was injured and those injuries “appeared consistent with a motor vehicle crash,” the report stated. The driver, later identified as Carter, who had “a history of resisting arrest,” matched the description of the vehicle’s driver. Carter, according to New Hampshire State Police reports, was arrested on domestic violence-simple assault and simple assault charges in September 2022 and escape, criminal mischief, and resisting arrest or detention charges in July 2023. The vehicle was registered to a family member, the officer wrote. \n\nThe first officer went to speak with Carter, accused him of having “bloodshot and glossy” eyes, and not being able to articulate any words as he spoke, the report stated. \n\n“Without prompting, he announced that ‘someone stole his car,’” the officer stated. \n\nCarter was accused of having a hard time balancing himself and walking and was detained, the officer wrote. The officer said Carter “kept saying he was going to throw up inside the cruiser” and also complained of arm pain. When asked if it was the car crash, “Lochland said it was,” the officer wrote. \n\nConcord fire and rescue teams were requested and took him to Concord Hospital.\n\nThe reporting officer viewed security footage from surveillance cameras and accused Carter of entering the garage around 4 a.m. Another man, with a beard, was in the passenger seat, and a second man was in the back seat. About 23 minutes later, the vehicle left the garage with only a driver inside, the report said. The two other men were seen leaving the garage on foot and walking onto Storrs Street. \n\nThe officer identified the two other men and spoke with them by phone later. One said the three of them had breakfast earlier at a diner in Manchester, but two decided to leave at the garage since Carter was acting “weird,” the affidavit said. \n\nDuring an interview at the hospital later, Carter said he “jumped out of a car,” and would not admit to driving it before the crash, the affidavit said. Later, in a witness statement, he scribbled, “Jumped out of my car, car was stolen,” the officer wrote. While speaking, the officer accused him of having “altered time/distance perception,” common with cannabis use, as well as having dilated pupils, the report said. \n\nCarter refused both field sobriety and blood tests at the hospital and was closing his eyes while attempting multiple times to sign the paperwork, the officer said. \n\nLater, Carter was taken to police headquarters, processed, refused bail, and was taken to county. He was scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 6.\n\n"},

The county strongly disputes the GOP narrative. \n\nThe RNC says that their lawsuit has been successful in getting Montgomery County to \"admit\" they did not follow proper procedures.\n\nSpecifically, the suit claimed that the county had not completed the necessary \"logic and accuracy\" testing of its machines, scanners, and ballot-marking devices, as required by state law, before the ballots were sent out, the RNC suit claims.\n\nIn reality, the county did complete the testing, but it was completed on Sept. 10, before the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's certification of the final ballot occurred on Sept. 16. Montgomery County says its just an effort to undermine the election. \n\n\"Voting has begun in Pennsylvania — and so has the RNC’s first line of attack on voting rights,\" Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija said. \"Here in Montgomery County, they’re threatening us under spurious legal grounds to breed distrust in voting systems, calling our ballots 'illegal' without any legitimate basis. We test our machines. Voting here is safe, secure, and no level of intimidation will prevent access to the ballot for every Montco citizen.\"\n\nThe lawsuit made national news and has drawn the attention of major Internet figures on the right — such as \n\n— who have used social media to get engagement on the issue from hundreds of thousands of supporters. \n\n“Election officials must be held accountable, and that’s exactly what we’ve done in Montgomery County,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. \"Rules, safeguards, and laws are critical to ensuring there are no holes in the system that undermine voters or election integrity. We have verified the facts, confirmed that the illegally sent ballots will be cast and counted properly, and protected early voters in the Keystone State.\"\n\nThough the preliminary injunction, which sought to stop mail-in balloting in Montgomery County altogether, has been withdrawn, the lawsuit against the county remains in place. \n\nThe county said from the beginning that the lawsuit's allegations were false, and an effort to undermine the election. After the lawsuit was filed the county completed additional testing, which appears to be what the RNC is characterizing as \"admitting\" wrongdoing. \n\nBecause the RNC withdrew their injunction, a judge will not have a chance to formally throw the request out of court, and a ruling on the suit itself is unlikely before Election Day.\n\nMontgomery County said this week that 42 percent of all mail-in ballots they've sent out have already been returned. \n\n"},

In spring, she banded with other advocacy groups on the installation of \n\n at local parks, a gesture that would allow grieving people to commune with nature, listening to wind on the other end of a phone, as they mourn their losses. \n\nThis fall, she and the groups hosted a \n\n, to highlight the victims of drug overdose. \n\nIf she wasn't busy enough, she's planning another day of free slices with Narcan training at Station Pizza in Stony Brook on Nov. 3. \n\nHer advocacy days are always emotional, she says. \n\nAnd Nov. 4 will be like every other — a day that won't go by without her crying, but she feels that every time she puts a Narcan kit in someone's hand, she is helping save a life. \n\n\"You certainly hope they won't have to use it, but what if they are in the right place and time where they could save someone's life?\" asked Trottere, an Old Field resident. \"So I do get satisfaction.\"\n\n\"There's not a lot of clean answers right to this problem,\" she said. \"There's no simple answers to this problem, but at least the Narcan keeps someone breathing, and hopefully they get help. They get a second chance.\"\n\nShe would have given anything to have been able to have a second chance with Alex. \n\nThe 30-year-old was living with her in Old Field, and he had been doing well. He was a welder and had just landed a big a job in Illinois for a big manufacturer before he died at a friend's apartment in Nassau County in April 2018.\n\nIf there had been a Narcan kit near Alex the morning he died, he might have been saved.\n\n\"But by the time the [Emergency Medical Technicians] got there, it was too late,\" she said. \"There should be Narcan kits in everybody's home today. It should be like a box of Band-aids.\"\n\n\"It doesn't always have to be for their family,\" Trottere said. \"You know, a lot of people, when we meet people out in public, they'll go, 'No, no — I don't need that in my family.' But what if you save someone else's life? You know? You could be in the grocery store, you could be on the train, you could be in a public place.\"\n\nTrottere keeps a kit on her keychain. \n\nShe made it herself by poking a hole in the kit's container. \n\nInstead of the keychain hand sanitizer popularized in the COVID-19 pandemic, she keeps a vial of Narcan close by.

The witness said she was \"1,000 percent sure\" it was Salgan, according to police reports obtained by Patch.\n\nPolice said students from Deerpath Middle School had been out on the turf field for gym class and on the playground that morning, and officers found security footage that showed Salgan sitting outside the entrance. \n\nThe next day, officers went to Salgan's Stablewood Lane home to speak with him. At first he denied having gone anywhere, but then admitted having gone to the book sale, telling officers that he goes there every year to pick up items to re-sell online.\n\n\"I told you, what if someone notices me?\" Salgan told his mother during the interview, police reported. \n\nWhen asked why he was worried about being noticed, he said because he \"didn't want to be embarrassed and that he's ashamed,\" police reported. \n\nSalgan did admit that officers had told him he was not allowed near parks or children, but told police \"there's not a single child there,\" explaining that he was unaware that there was a pre-school inside the rec center.\n\nSalgan is required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life under the terms of a plea agreement he made earlier this year to resolve a case with Lake County prosecutors.\n\nIn that case, Salgan was indicted in September 2022 in connection with a Lake Forest police investigation that began nearly 18 months earlier. \n\n that Salgan admitted to investigators that he had downloaded child sexual abuse materials on his cell phone. His parents told investigators that Salgan was a \"hoarder\" who operated a business selling DVDs out of their basement, according to police reports.\n\nIn June, on the eve of trial, Salgan entered a negotiated plea with Lake County prosecutors that saw him avoid jail time after he admitted to one count of possession of child pornography in exchange for a sentence of 30 months of probation, 100 hours of public service and a lifetime of sex offender registration.\n\nOn Sept. 17, prosecutors approved four new felony charges against Salgan for his trip to the library book sale — unlawful loitering within a school zone, unlawful loitering within a public park and two counts of unlawful presence within a school zone.\n\nOfficers measured the distance from where Salgan was spotted to the grounds of Deerpath Middle School and the surrounding fields, finding that he entered the rec center less than 80 feet from the pickup area from the city-operated Kinderhaven Preschool Academy.\n\nThe new case has prompted criticism from local parent group Parents Care. Its members have expressed frustration over the failure of Lake Forest School District 67 administrators to notify families about the arrest of a registered sex offender who was allegedly near school grounds. \n\n\"The presence of a registered sex offender near school grounds, especially in proximity to children, represents a potential safety risk that parents deserve to know about. Deer Path Parents deserve to know so they can ask their children if, God forbid, they had any interaction with this individual,\" representatives of the group said in a statement.\n\nPolice reports show no indication that any school officials were involved in the investigation. \n\nDistrict Superintendent Matthew Montgomery has not issued a public comment on the matter but has previously referred to Parents Care as an \"\n\n\" in disputes over communication policies. \n\nMontgomery did not respond Tuesday to questions regarding his administration's policy regarding notifying parents when people are arrested on or near campus for sex offenses and why his administration decided not to disclose Salgan's arrest to the public.\n\nHowever, in an Oct. 3 message, Chuck Walsh, the safety and security director for Lake Forest School Districts 67 and 115, made several misleading statements about the arrest in an attempt to explain why administrators never disclosed it to the public.\n\n\"Our protocol is to communicate to families as soon as possible if a safety issue involves their child or one of our schools,\" Walsh said, \"this incident did not.\"\n\nWalsh said the \"community book fair was held at the Lake Forest Recreation Center outside of school hours.\" \n\nBut, in fact, the book fair was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on a school day, and police reported it was about 10:30 a.m. when Salgan was spotted in a school zone. \n\nAnd, according to police, there were Deerpath Middle School students outside for gym class that morning on the turf field and the playground. \n\n\"While Salgan was in the book fair, I observed multiple juveniles entering and exiting the northwest entrance with bags and boxes of books,\" Officer Madison Polster reported.\n\nOther misleading statements from Walsh include the suggestion that Salgan was arrested on the day of the incident. \n\n\"An arrest was made, and the individual was removed,\" Walsh said. \n\nBut, in fact, Salgan was not arrested until he turned himself in five days later.\n\nWalsh claimed he only learned about the incident on the day Parents Care sent out an email, which the school administrator ironically described as \"sensationalized and inaccurate mass communication.\" \n\nThe Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act mandates strict boundaries for child sex offenders, preventing them from being within 500 feet of schools, parks, and other areas where children gather. Violating these restrictions is a class 4 felony, punishable by up to 3 years in prison.\n\n\"By not reporting, the district risks appearing to downplay or conceal information that parents would consider critical to their children's safety,\" said Parents Care representatives, \"which could erode trust and confidence in the administration.\"\n\nCourt records show Salgan is due back in court Sept. 28 for a preliminary status hearing on the new charges. \n\n"},

As of Tuesday, there are about 180 spots available in its kennels at 124 Evergreen Avenue – and about 200 dogs in its care.\n\nThe shelter recently \n\n, saying that it doesn’t have a single kennel open for incoming dogs. The situation is urgent … and has been for quite some time, staff say.\n\n“Unfortunately, this means that stray and lost dogs will have to stay in temporary, transient setups, and we can no longer assist families needing to surrender their pets,” the shelter reported last week.\n\nTo complicate matters, food supplies are running “dangerously low” at the AHS-Newark shelter, which serves the largest city in New Jersey and contracts to provide services for several other nearby municipalities.\n\nThis frustrating reality – a shelter operating at “critical capacity” – has unfortunately been the status quo at the AHS-Newark \n\n, a spokesperson told Patch on Tuesday.\n\n“We have been posting an urgent need for fosters, adopters and rescues for some time, but there is little that is helping the matter,” she said. “It seems that when five dogs leave the building, 15 are coming in as strays, neglected or abandoned or as surrenders, to take their place.”\n\nDog intakes (either strays or surrenders) at AHS-Newark have increased 48 percent since 2022. It’s a pattern that other shelters in North Jersey – and nationally – have also been seeing. \n\nAccording to the AHS-Newark – which receives many larger bully breeds that would be best for homes with older kids – there is an urgent need for families, empty nesters, childless millennials and more to open their homes in an hour of need.\n\nIn particular, foster homes could help these overflow dogs “destress” from a kennel environment, teach them new skills and better set them up for a forever home. \n\nHere are three things the community can do to give the doggos and kitties at the Newark shelter a much-needed boost, staff said:\n\nNeed some inspiration to get things started? Look no further than Bella, an 8-year-old pittie mix who just marked her first anniversary in the shelter, having been surrendered in Oct of 2023.\n\nAccording to the shelter:\n\nBella not a fit for your household? Check out the many other dogs and cats available for adoption at the AHS-Newark shelter \n\n, or learn about a few below:\n\n– “Seamus is the definition of ‘work hard, play hard!’ He’s obsessed with his toys and is super dog friendly. At just 3 years old, this sweet boy has already spent 312 days in the shelter—almost a third of his life! No dog should live in a kennel that long, and unfortunately, Seamus is starting to feel the effects of shelter stress, like weight loss. Seamus is looking for a loving adult adopter who can give him the home he deserves. He’s friendly with both people and dogs and is absolutely begging for his way out of the shelter.”\n\n– “At 5 years old, Brock is deliciously squishy and full of love! This chunky boy loves his walks, treats, and soaking up all the affection he can get. He’s the perfect companion for any dog-loving family! Brock is neutered, friendly with dogs, and best suited for a home with older kids or teens due to his size. He’s all set to rock 'n' roll right on out of the shelter!”\n\n– “Rocco is a 2-3 year old brindle sweetheart who loves nothing more than being wrapped up like a four legged burrito! He’s dog friendly and great with sturdy kids, making him a perfect match for a family in need of a loving, snuggly companion. Rocco is neutered and ready to kiss his kennel good bye. He has great manners, knows several commands like sit, down and paw- with a great appetite for treats the new commands he can learn are limitless.”\n\n– “Coming in at 105lbs Duchess the Doberman is the goodest of girls. Found as lost dog, Duchess needs a new start. It’s a good thing she’s such a good girl then- friendly with dogs and older kids due to her size. Duchess is incredibly smart and knows all sorts of commands: sit, paw and down are all in her wheel house. Duchess is up to date on vaccines and will be spayed upon adoption.”\n\n– “Meadow is a 2 year old, 35lb sweetheart currently in foster care and ready to find her forever home. This little lovebug is house trained, gets along with other dogs (she’s besties with her foster fur brother), and appears to be a great fit for a family with sturdy or older kids! Meadow is gentle, sweet, and already spayed—just waiting for her perfect match! Adopt her today so she doesn’t have to go back to the shelter!”\n\n"},

To this day, his menu is much the same as when he first opened, showcasing original favorites and new offerings. The specials have been around since the doors opened: lobster ravioli, sea bass, linguine pescatore, filet mignon, and more. \n\n“Everyone who comes wants to order the same thing every visit,” he said. “The community loves the original recipes. I have customers who have come for 25 years, and they hug me and tell me they had to return and visit though they moved away, and it’s a great thing.” \n\nAlex says Gourmet Italia is \"where customers become friends and friends become family.\"\n\nLooking back at the restaurant’s beginnings, he recalls how guests would line up and wait for one of seven tables nightly. \n\nHis food and welcoming service, treating all guests like family, gained Gourmet Italia a loyal following and made it frequently recommended by word-of-mouth. Before long, the restaurant became a rapid success and grew beyond its initial footprint. \n\n“Alex would often burst into song or pull up a chair and talk to guests and get to know everyone,” Charity Prestifilippo said. \"He's made everyone feel special here, including me.\"\n\nThat personal attention made Gourmet Italia into one of Temecula’s favorite “special occasion” restaurants for birthdays, anniversaries, proms, and wedding receptions. \n\nHe launches into stories and memories when asked about some of his favorite moments.\n\n“Couples get engaged here, then they bring their children, they celebrate anniversaries, then they become grandparents,” he said. “We’ve had some circle of life moments, with funeral receptions for some of our longtime customers. It’s very sad and uniquely special to be involved in their lives for so long.” \n\nStill, one of Alex and Charity's favorite memories is meeting each other at Gourmet Italia in the early 2000s and falling in love.\n\nLater, when they became engaged, they returned to share the news with wait staff and guests. \n\n\"The servers and customers all encouraged Alex to get down on one knee and propose to me again,” she said, laughing. He served everyone tiramisu to celebrate our engagement that night!”\n\nThe couple shared photos of their journey with Patch, showing how the restaurant is a backdrop for some of their favorite memories.\n\nOf the meaning behind the anniversary, Alex smiled. \n\n“The 25th, for me, is just a number, but it is an important number, it means I’m still here,” he said. “You look behind you and see what this little place people that I miss, people that I lost, people that I gained. It’s all thanks to this. This restaurant is my life.” \n\nBe sure to visit \n\n for its 25th Anniversary celebration, or come for yours! And tell them Patch sent you.\n\n"},

The witness saw Pullen and Cole at the front porch and \"flashes coming from the area of the defendant and heard several gunshots,\" the petition outlines.\n\nAnother eyewitness told Joliet police \"he was at the residence trying to get high when Everett came in, kicked the female's date out, and came upstairs. Everett came into the kitchen and told everyone else they had to get out. (Pullen) yelled, 'Move, move,' and shot him four or five times,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nThat particular witness later led Joliet police to the murder weapon Pullen had left inside his car, a black Glock with a brown extended magazine and a live 9mm round in the chamber, the petition notes.\n\nFour days after the slaying, on Oct. 9, Joliet police took Pullen into custody. \n\n\"After telling detectives several inconsistent accounts, Pullen eventually stated that he was at the residence of 830 Wenberg Street on October 5, 2024 when he heard shouting outside. Pullen stated that the female told Pullen that ... \"TY\" (street name for Everett Cole) was \"beating on her,\" court documents indicate. Pullen went downstairs, and TY bumped into Pullen on the way in. After TY walked upstairs, Pullen followed him and TY started telling everyone to get out of the house.\n\n\"TY reached towards his right hip, Pullen pushed TY and BJ out of the way and grabbed a gun near the chimney area and shot TY three to four times,\" McKenna noted. \"Pullen said the gun he used was not his and it was more of a house gun to keep the house safe.\"\n\nWhen the Kia parked in the alley would not start, Pullen left the gun on the front passenger seat; he and the woman left the property, driving a gray Volvo, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Pullen stated that he drove to Chicago, where he stopped at the 63rd Street Beach and threw the clothes he was wearing in Lake Michigan and put on new clothes which were already in the gray Volvo,\" prosecutors stated.\n\nAs for Pullen, he received first offender gun probation for a crime out of Cook County. \"He lives in Chicago and does not have any property interest in 830 Wenberg, Joliet, Illinois,\" McKenna declared. \"There are no less restrictive means which would insure the defendant would comply with the laws, as even being on probation for a firearms offense has not prevented him from continuing to break the law.\"\n\n"},

The new, nuclear SNP — single nucleotide polymorphism , from a hair shaft — DNA has not yet been deemed admissible in New York State, Tierney said.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Nicholas Santomartino said the defense had been given 99.9 percent of the raw data from the more than 400 electronic devices taken from the Heuermann home; in total, the prosecution has provided the defense with about 120 terabytes of material.\n\nHeuermann's next court date is December 17. Mazzei asked Brown if, in December, he would have spoken with the DA and determined if the motion for the Frye hearing was necessary; if the hearing were to take place, Mazzei said he'd like to see it take place in the spring.\n\nBecause the nuclear DNA method is new, a \"first impression\" for Suffolk County, Mazei said Brown could review the DNA evidence and then he and Tierney could try to come to some kind of agreement about the parameters, possibly oblivating the need for a motion. He asked Brown if he had a DNA expert to review the evidence, Brown said he did.\n\nMazzei said that with the next conference in December, \"we're moving in the right direction.\" He said he understood the enormous amount of discovery in the case and realized everyone had been working very hard. \n\nBut, he added, \"very, very soon,\" he'd like to schedule any hearing and ultimately, the trial, possibly even on December 17. \"I implore the DA's office to complete the discovery process by that date,\" he said, adding that he understood the complexity and volume involved.\n\nSpeaking with the media, Tierney said there was a \"tremendous amount\" of information and DNA analysis that needed to be provided to the defense by December 17. \"We are pumping out an extraordinary amount of discovery.\"\n\nHe said all he could do was \"try\" to meet the deadline; professionals deserved to be \"compensated for their hard work,\" he said. \"That costs money. We don't have any more money. We have this pool of money that we can't get to.\"\n\nTierney said the Suffolk County DA's office has \"forfeiture money\" totaling about $13 million that has been frozen as a \"result of an investigation that occurred prior to my administration. . . Especially when you look at this volume of discovery, in light of the ridiculous New York State discovery laws, which we have to comply with, it's a money issue, it's a budgetary issue. So I would love to have that money and be able to use it to bring this case to a resolution.\"\n\nTierney said he would go to the Department of Justice \"once again, hat in hand, and I will beg them, 'Please, give me this money so I can litigate this very significant serial killer case' and we'll see what our federal government tells me.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on why the money had been frozen, except to say it was related to an issue with forfeiture practice; the money — garnered from previous, for example, drug cases —was frozen during the last administration on September 11, 2020. \n\nThe DOJ did not immediately return a request for comment on why the funds were frozen.\n\nNewsday reported in 2023 that \n\n how the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office used asset forfeiture funds in undercover money laundering operations during the tenure of ex-District Attorneys Thomas Spota and Timothy Sini, according to a letter from an official in the DA's office.\n\nAccording to the Newsday report, the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles and the FBI put the brakes on the DA Office's ability\n\n for more than two years.\n\nTierney described the situation as a \"common sense issue. We have all this money, we can't use it, so let us use it.\"\n\nIf he receives the funds, Tierney said he'd pay the discovery expediters, analysts, and investigators. With more money, more employees can be put on the case and they could \"work essentially 24 hours a day. But again that costs money that we have, but can't use. We're asking for this money not so we can redecorate our office — but so we can comply with the very ambitious discovery demands of this case.\"\n\nHe added that he thinks the timeline as it stands, \"is very ambitious and very compressed. Again, given the ridiculous nature of our discovery laws, where I have to provide every single piece of paper that was generated in a case that started in 1993. It is a monumental amount. That's what our legislature told us was necessary to do. We'll do it. Just give us the money.\"\n\nTierney said the investigation continues on many different fronts, including possible victims. When asked about future charges he said he speaks through indictments and would speak if that occurred.\n\nBrown, speaking with the media Wednesday, said the Frye hearing was very important to the defense. \n\nHe said the case, from the prosecution's standpoint, centers on the DNA evidence. \"The Frye hearing is to determine whether this fellow on the West Coast who has come up with these results that try to point to our client are going to come in to the course of the trial as evidence. The judge is going to have to decide whether or not, in the scientific community, this is acceptable.\"\n\nHe added that the new, nuclear DNA analyses came after the mitochrondial DNA. \"The crime lab in Suffolk County indicated under oath to a grand jury that these hairs we are talking about were unsuitable for nuclear DNA analysis.\"\n\nThe mitochondrial DNA analysis was \"unconvincing\", he said, with thousands of potential people who could be linked to them. \"Then we were told that magically from the West Coast we now had nuclear DNA.\"\n\nThe crime lab on the West Coast, a for-profit company is not accredited in New York, he said; their work has not been subject to peer review, Brown accused.\n\nHe said the results are \"not fair and should not come into evidence. There is no science behind it.\"\n\nShould the judge deny the Frye hearing, Brown said, there will be no recourse.\n\nDiscussing the timelines, his client Heuermann, Brown said, \"wants his trial. He wants his day in court. But we're moving forward, which we're happy about.\"\n\nWhen asked about Heuermann was paying for the lengthy process, Brown said he was an assigned attorney and Heuermann was not paying out of his pocket; the court was responsible for payment, he said.\n\nBrown said he's been discussing a change of venue. When asked where, Brown joked, \"Mars. I say that in jest only because I don't know where it is that we'll be able to get a fair and impartial jury in Suffolk County.\"\n\nHe said former law enforcement officials and others have \"poisoned our jury\" with comments to the public and press that \"have no place\" including Heuermann's \"stare\" and his \"devil eyes\" and that he \"has no emotion.\"\n\nBrown also said it was critical to sever the fifth and sixth victims in the indictment from the first four; trying the cases separate and apart. \"There is virtually no evidence in the last two cases and with the Gilgo Four, the evidence is very weak,\" he said.\n\nBrown once again said that he believed that there were other possible suspects in the case — one of whom was dismissed over \"two sentences\" — and he said the investigation had been \"suppressed\" and wanted that investigated.\n\nHe also said that Shannan Gilbert should be included in the investigation; although she has never been included as a victim, and her death was deemed an accident, she was the only victim heard screaming that they \"were going to kill her\" and her remains were found near the Gilgo Four, he said.\n\nBrown said Heuermann was still in isolation, unable to interact with other inmates or have socialization; he said he understands that the process would be lengthy. \"He's anxious to get to trial. He understands that he will have his day in court but that may take awhile.\"\n\nAsa Ellerup, Heuermann's estranged wife, was not in court Wednesday; she was in South Carolina, her attorney Robert Macedonio said.\n\nRecently, lawyers for both his wife and children said the family is finally, after two exhaustive searches and a \n\ne, seeing some of \n\n.\n\nThis June, Heuermann was s\n\n in the deaths of two additional women, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, according to a superceding bail application released to the press before the proceedings — bringing the total number of his alleged victims to six.\n\nIn July 2023, Heuermann was \n\n Melissa Barthelemy, MeganWaterman and Amber Costello, whose remains were found along Ocean Parkway in 2010.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nA total of 11 sets of remains were found in the Gilgo Beach murders, which rocked Long Island. The remains included that of a toddler and an Asian male.\n\nHeuermann was also charged with the \n\n, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, in January. New DNA evidence helped connect Heuermann to all four of the deaths, said Tierney, who is prosecuting the case.\n\nHeuermann was charged with second-degree murder, an A-1 violent felony, in the death of Brainard-Barnes on July 9, 2007. Heuermann has also pleaded not guilty to that charge.\n\nHeuermann \n\n for a routine appearance where \"voluminous amounts\" of discovery were turned over to the defense, according to Tierney — and at the time, the DA said it was \"safe to say\" that he might be considered a suspect in the death of a seventh woman.\n\nWhen asked if Heuermann may be \n\n, whose remains were found in Manorville and near Cedar Beach, Tierney said: \"It's safe to say he would be a suspect, yes.\"\n\nNew details were released recently about an \n\n found in the same areas as those associated with the Gilgo Beach killings, Tierney said — and law enforcement is appealing to the public to identify the individual and bring closure to his or her family.\n\n"},

Currently, the site is a parking lot. \n\nThirty percent of Park Edge's apartments would be saved for formerly homeless seniors, Olga Jobe, the city's developing partner, said in a Zoom meeting with the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council on Tuesday night. \n\nThe rest would be available through a lottery on \n\n, with a 20 percent priority given to adults who live in the Community Board District 8.\n\nJobe said the developers have also designed a community space in the building, a walkway and terrace, with input from community members. \n\n\"Some of the feedback we got was around health and wellness, arts, music classes for adults and children, as well as after-school programming,\" Jobe said, about a public feedback session over the summer. \"All of these things are in line with what we envision for the space.\"\n\nThe second development, at 516 Bergen St., would be turned into a building called Bergen Green with 112 affordable apartments and community gathering spaces, space for social services provided by the nonprofit \n\n, and a public landscaped terrace. Currently, the lot includes a vacant building with some basement parking.\n\nThe new apartments would be part of New York City Housing Preservation and Development's Extremely Low- and Low- Income Affordability program, and 60 percent of the homes will be available to families earning up to $76,260 for a family of three. \n\nAnd, 15 percent of the homes will be reserved for formerly homeless people, Lee Brathwaite, the CEO of Apex Building Group, the city's development partner on the project, said. All homes would be available via lottery on Housing Connect. \n\nBrathwaite said that, like Park Edge, Bergen Green also intends to build community gathering space and build cultural programming into the building.\n\n\"We want to continue to engage with the community and make sure that we're identifying the right kind of partners to participate with us,\" Brathwaite said. \n\nThe public review process for the Atlantic Avenue Mixed-Use Plan — which includes these two buildings — is constrained to a seven-month period, so it will likely be voted on by City Council in May 2025.

Olde Silver Tavern is a town landmark, and James Lawson said he knows how much the space means to Manalapan residents. \n\n“I’ve lived in the community since 1999,” Lawson said. “I visited the old place [before the tavern was closed], my children all went to Manalapan High School — we were in the old venue at least once a week.”\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself for Lawson to buy the tavern with his wife Sandra and fellow couple Vanessa and Gus DiFiglia, Lawson said it was “a no-brainer.”\n\n“I think we brought a beautiful building and facility back to life,” Lawson said. “The old place was kind of collapsing on itself, and I think now we have a facility that suits the area and can handle the amount of people.” \n\nFor the Lawsons and DiFiglias, revitalizing Olde Silver Tavern was about more than just physical repairs. \n\nAccording to James Lawson, many of the restaurant’s patrons grew up in the tri-state area. As someone who worked in Brooklyn for almost 30 years, Lawson said he wanted to re-create the sense of community customers were familiar with at establishments back home. \n\n“I think what we’re trying to do is recreate what made it really good without the structural and physical deficiencies the old place had,” Lawson said. “Many people that live in this area now are from the New York tri-state area, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and we want to re-create that sense of community, where, you know, the tavern becomes a meeting place — it’s a public house.”\n\nAccording to Vanessa DiFiglia, the tavern’s “public house” function can have multiple purposes. \n\n\"We do celebrations, we've had baptisms, baby showers, birthdays, retirements,\" DiFiglia said. \"Plus, we're very sports-oriented. We have televisions around the bar and on the patio, so people can come and watch games.\" \n\nWhether it’s a birthday celebration, town meeting, or just a group of friends who want to watch a game, the restaurant's owners want Olde Silver Tavern to be the first option for community gatherings. \n\n“We want to be that place where people are like ‘Oh wow, they have space,’ or ‘Oh, they have that extra room,’” Lawson said. “And not just community in Manalapan, but the surrounding towns also. There’s value to being able to sit down and talk face-to-face that you can’t get on Zoom.”\n\nMore than anything, the owners want customers to know that, to them, they’re more than customers. When people visit Olde Silver Tavern, James Lawson and Vanessa DiFiglia said they want them to feel like they’re at home.\n\n“They’re not customers,” Lawson said. “They become friends.

The style that I’m cooking with. It covers a wide range, so there’s everything from appetizers to desserts, vegan dishes, pasta dishes, seafood, meat. It leans across the board, whereas my past couple of books were focused more on specific things.\"\n\n\"Burgers, Bowls and Jars,\" focused on burgers and jarred foods; \"Small Bites, Big Flavors\" put small appetizers at the forefront; and \"Stick It, Spoon It, Put It In A Glass\" was geared toward the catering and restaurant industries.\n\n\"Forkin' Good,\" what LeVine says is his \"most complete\" cookbook, \n\n.

Bring people back to the kitchen and have fun together cooking, because cooking, when you think about it growing up, that was the hub. Every party, every family gathering, was about food. It always surrounded food. My greatest memories are when my grandmother cooked for me. I always love to be able to share that. Hopefully people will feel that same thing, the love in each dish.\"\n\n back-to-back Long Island Chef of the Year in the Bethpage Best Awards for 2023 and 2024. He is a champion of The Food Network's \"Chopped.\" He was also featured on \"Beat Bobby Flay,\" \"Food Paradise,\" and \"Alex Vs America,\" and \"Morimoto's Sushi Master,\" among other shows.\n\nWhile LeVine is known for crafting delicious recipes at 317 Main Street and in competitions, he said a \"key\" to \"Forkin' Good\" is that people should not feel intimidated by his recipes.\n\n\"Everything is geared towards the home cook,\" he said. \"Not geared toward the restaurant, the restaurant industry or the professional chef. It’s geared towards the person who loves to try different things at home, recipes that have been done multiple times in multiple ways. And it’s things that we would even use in our cooking classes at 317 Main Street. It’s dishes and ideas that come broad-stroke. There’s nothing that’s difficult. Things that are very common; just twisted my way.\"\n\nThe foreword was written by Kathy Fang, who hosts \"House of Fang\" on The Food Network. She also has a restaurant in California. LeVine called her an \"amazing chef.\"\n\n\"I was inspired by her, because I saw someone who was a go-at-it person,\" LeVine said. \"So when we talked about it, she was like, ‘I don’t know how to write a foreword.’ I said, ‘Here are some ideas from the book. Build it from there. You know who I am.’ So for me, it was really cool to have her do it. Coming from a different point of view. Someone who knows me but not someone I’ve known forever.

As of Wednesday afternoon, nearly $3,500 of the $10,000 goal had been raised. \n\n“Her house is completely gone now,” her great-grandson, Rylee Huston, told Patch. “Her property is on a canal. It came from the side of the canal and swept into the side of her home. The roof was entirely ripped off.”\n\nAll that remains are the walls of Jayne’s bedrooms, the kitchen and the garage, he said. \n\nHis great-grandmother is hospitalized at Cleveland Clinic’s Martin South Hospital in Stuart as she recovers from surgery on her left foot, which was injured during the hurricane and prevents her from walking on her own. \n\nShe’s also covered in bruises after the roof lifted off and landed on her back as the pieces fell on top of her, Rylee said. \n\nJayne will remain hospitalized while recovering, but her goal is to return to living on her own, whether in a new home or her old one if it can be restored. \n\n“But it’s in an unlivable state,” he said. “It’s a complete teardown if we’re going to rebuild.”\n\nBorn in 1919, Jayne moved to Florida at a young age with her family. She’s lived a storied life, marrying twice and traveling the world. \n\nShe’s lived in her Rocky Pointe home for decades, at least, Rylee said. \n\n“She’s been in that same spot as long as I’ve been alive, 22 years, and I’m sure she’s been in it at least 20 more,” he said. \n\nJayne cherishes her family, which is spread out now, though Rylee and his parents live nearby and check on her frequently. \n\nShe also values her independence. \n\n“She is 100 percent aware; she is cognizant,” her great-grandson said. “She is sharp. She is there. She has no doubt about what she wants. She doesn’t want to be in assisted living; she wants to be in her home, in some sort of independent living.”\n\nWhile she’s mourning the loss of her home and her memories, she remains hopeful for her family and the future, he added. \n\n“She is quite a story, definitely,” Rylee said. “She’s 105. She’s survived pretty much everything. She’s a fighter. She hasn’t stopped and won’t stop. It’s amazing and it’s a miracle that she survived and that she continues to be so independent in such a dark time.”\n\n"},
