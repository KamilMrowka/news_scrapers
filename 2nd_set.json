Supreme Court, were “surprised” when an RCMP search warrant revealed the existence of a 200-page manuscript handwritten by Pickton. \n\n“We had been led to believe that the investigation had concluded and the RCMP had no further leads,” Gratl said. “Now the RCMP says there’s nothing of interest in the 200-page manuscript, but we prefer to read it for ourselves.” \n\nA search warrant filed in New Westminster, B.C., this summer said prison officials found “numerous writings and notes authored by Pickton” after going  through his things  in search of a will following his death in May. \n\nThe “information to obtain” document said Quebec prison officials had a “cursory read” of Pickton’s manuscript, which was titled . \n\nCpl. Craig Mitchell, who applied for the warrant, said in the application that he believed Pickton wanted to give a “full account” of the murders in court, having interviewed him after he was convicted. \n\nThe search warrant document said investigators with the Missing Women Task Force had met with Pickton on “numerous occasions,” trying to coax him to identify an unknown victim, still known to this day as “Jane Doe.” \n\n“I believe that Pickton wanted to tell his story of the murders he committed,” Mitchell wrote. “I believe he would have written down his account of the murders and his account in the book titled  and any related written documents or notes he made when writing that book.”\n\nMitchell said Pickton’s writings could help investigators link Pickton, and potentially others, to murders committed on the serial killer’s Port Coquitlam property, and though he was charged with killing 27 women, he  later admitted to 49 murders . \n\n“I believe Pickton committed 49 murders and the book and related documents and notes may identify the other victims not yet known.” \n\nGratl said he’ll seek a copy of the manuscript for its “potential relevance” to his clients’ civil lawsuits against the Pickton brothers, as they work to consolidate the cases and set a trial.\n\nSgt. Vanessa Munn, a media relations officer with the RCMP, said the writings seized were “thoroughly examined” but didn’t refer to any missing women or his crimes and investigators have “unfortunately” no new information to share with the victims’ families. \n\n“We recognize that there are families with questions about their loved one’s disappearances, however the content of writings did not provide any answers,” Munn said in a written statement. \n\nPickton was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder for the killings of Mona Wilson, Sereena Abotsway, Georgina Papin, Marnie Frey, Brenda Wolfe and Andrea Joesbury in 2007 and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe remaining charges against him were stayed.\n\n"},

On the ice, Kadri showed talent early on. But in an environment where most of his teammates and their families were white, the Muslim hockey player encountered racism as well.\n\n“As a young kid you don’t quite understand how to navigate that, so I leaned on my family lots.”\n\nRacist comments would follow Kadri throughout his professional career. During the Stanley Cup playoffs with Colorado,  Kadri received racially motivated hate and death threats.  It’s why after winning the Stanley Cup, Kadri was moved to bring the trophy back to his hometown to celebrate the city’s Muslim community at a local mosque\n\n“It was special for me,” Kadri recalled.  Among the children he met on that day was a little boy who had also experienced racism and hate.  On June 6, 2021, four members of a London family were killed while out for a walk.  The family was deliberately struck while waiting at the intersection, targeted because they were Muslim.\n\nSalman Afzaal, 46, his wife Madiha Salman, 44, their 15-year-old daughter Yumna Afzaal and Salman’s 74-year-old mother Talat Afzaal were killed. The couple’s then nine-year-old son was the only survivor\n\nKadri says he saw himself in that little boy.\n\n“That was one of my favourite moments of bringing the Stanley Cup to my hometown,” Kadri said. “Just to understand and see how grateful and happy they were after, you know, something like that.”\n\nIn 2020, Kadri co-founded the Hockey Diversity Alliance with seven other NHL players to shine a light on racism in the sport.\n\n“(We’re a) bunch of great people that have experienced similar issues firsthand,” he said.  “We’ve seen it and heard it and lived it.  The initiative is to combat racism in underserved communities and give kids the opportunity to play hockey and that’s something we’re working very diligently on.”\n\nKadri hopes it will be part of his legacy to the sport for the next generation of Muslim players and his own child as well.  However, Kadri says he’s not sure if hockey will be his five-year-old’s sport of choice.\n\n“I don’t know,” he laughs. “She’s more of a tennis player but we’ll definitely get her on the ice.”\n\n \n\n"},

A fourth said the documents appeared legitimate.\n\nThe documents, attributed to the U.S. Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency and marked “top secret,” indicate that Israel is building military capabilities to carry out a military attack in response to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack.\n\nThe U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe United States has urged Israel to push for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip following the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this week. However, neither Israel nor Hamas have shown renewed interest in such a deal after months of negotiations broke down in August.\n\nIran backs Hamas and the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, where a year of escalating tensions erupted into all-out war last month. Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon in early October.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes in Beit Lahiya. It said it “continues to operate throughout the Gaza Strip, with airstrikes and ground operations.”\n\nThe dead included two parents and their four children, as well as a woman, her son, her daughter-in-law and their four children, according to Raheem Kheder, a medic. He said the strike levelled a multi-story building and at least four neighbouring homes.\n\nMounir al-Bursh, director general of the Health Ministry, said the influx of wounded people following the strikes was worsening “an already catastrophic situation for the health care system” in the northern Gaza Strip, in a message posted on the social network X.\n\nInternet connectivity was cut off in the northern Gaza Strip late Saturday and had not been restored by midday Sunday, making it difficult to gather information about the strikes.\n\nFor the past two weeks, Israel has been conducting a major operation in the Jabaliya urban refugee camp, also located in the northern Gaza Strip. The army claims to have launched the operation against Hamas militants who had gathered there.\n\nThe north has already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war and has been surrounded by Israeli forces since late last year, following Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel.\n\nIsrael ordered the entire population of the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the first weeks of the war, and reiterated those instructions earlier this month. Most of the population fled last year, but an estimated 400,000 people remain in the north.\n\nPalestinians who fled the north at the start of the war are still not allowed to return.\n\n"},

{"title": "Are we entering a new analogue age? Gen Z is leading us there", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor decades, we've lived in a digital world. Now gen Z is reversing that.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10815709/new-analogue-age-gen-z/", "article": "We first heard about the brave new world of “digital” at the end of the 1970s. We weren’t sure what that meant, but it sounded futuristic and cool, especially with music. It held the promise of accuracy and greater fidelity that we could feed to our monster stereo systems. Ry Cooder has gone down in history as the first artist to release a digitally recorded album with  in 1979.\n\nThe CD came along a few years later, adding to digital’s momentum. Soon, all recording studios began migrating from their giant analogue tape machines and consoles to state-of-the-art hard drive systems powered by software like Pro Tools. By the end of the ’90s, everything was digital: CDs, MP3s, personal music devices and so on. Beyond a few outliers who wouldn’t let go — I’m looking at you, Jack White, Lenny Kravitz and anyone who refused to give up their  vinyl  albums — analogue music was essentially dead.\n\nIt’s all different now, of course. Even though streaming is the dominant form of music consumption, analogue is still very much with us. Artists looking for a particular recording vibe seek out studios still equipped with ancient two-inch, 24-track tape machines. Vinyl sales have been on an upward trajectory since 2008. Even cassettes refuse to go away.\n\n \n\nBut this yearning for analogue goes deeper and much of it lies with gen Z. The first generation to grow up in an always-on, always-connected digital world, is looking for something more tangible. They’re expressing nostalgia for an era before they were born.\n\nMany late millennials and gen Z (and no doubt the newest cohort, gen alpha) seem to have a thing for the Before Times, an era when things were less complicated, more orderly, less divided and had more substance, and a time when everyone wasn’t glued to their devices 24-7. Today, these generations see nothing but crazy politics, forever wars, the  climate crisis , an imbalanced economic system, a firehose of disinformation, and a social media ecosystem — something that’s used by half of all humans on the planet — that’s intent on making them feel inadequate. Now they’re facing a few run by  AI .\n\nIn other words, they want some imagined Good Old Days. Young people are feeling stressed out, hopeless, scared and alone. Gen Z’s interest in things they can touch, hold and physically possess is helping them find stability in a turbulent world.\n\nWhen it comes to music, I’m seeing plenty of anecdotal evidence. Young people have fallen in love with vinyl, scooping up as much as they can afford. Ask any indie record store what they’re buying and they’ll tell you it’s the classics: The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd. Any used copy of Fleetwood Mac’s  that comes in is sold within seconds. At record shows, that’s the first thing people search for.\n\nMany of these young vinyl collectors don’t have a turntable because they don’t need to. They can lie on their bed examining their new physical album purchase for its artwork, liner notes and lyrics while streaming it. From that perspective, it’s the best of both worlds. It also offers a break from screens. Some have ditched listening on headphones, too, because they can make one feel disconnected.\n\nCD sales are still falling, but the rate of decline may be slowing as gen Z gets into that format, too. For them, the CD is just as ancient as an LP or a cassette, but it’s a real-world object. That’s both a novelty and reassuring. And physical representations of music have given birth to a new type of fandom, status and expression of identity. “I’m willing to spend THIS MUCH on things like records and CDs to prove that I’m a big music fan! I have five feet of shelving to display my music collection!” Trying doing that with Spotify or a hard drive full of digital files.\n\nArtists have been responding to this trend, led by  Taylor Swift  and her endless issuance of multiple vinyl versions. Physical editions help fuel fandom and superfandom. The Weeknd, Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter know this, too.\n\nI spoke at a high school earlier this month in front of about 300 students, a sizable portion of whom were wearing T-shirts displaying the logos of ’90s bands: Nirvana, Rush, Metallica, The Hip, even more niche acts like Suicidal Tendencies. Such retro merch far, far exceeded that of any current artist. When I asked a few of them about their favourite era of music, most of them cited the ’90s.\n\nI also spotted more than one student rocking a flip phone. This desire for feature-free phones has caught the attention of the industry. Earlier this year,  The Boring Phone  was released and was so successful that  a second version is coming soon . “Tired of being controlled by your phone? It’s time for a change. Introducing BP2 (Boring Phone 2) – the next generation of tech that respects your time and attention.” They could have also added, “We won’t harvest your personal data so that we can sell it.”\n\nIt’s not just phones, either.  Notice that standalone cameras are back again thanks to gen Z?  Not just film cameras, either; even the Polaroid camera is a thing again. The somethings grainy, often imperfect photos that result are valued for their realness and authenticity.\n\nWe need to pay attention because the market always follows the trends of the youngest generation of consumers. Brands know they need to tap into retro trends if they want to communicate with gen Z authentically. Where the kids go, we all go.\n\nWhat’s next? A reversal of fortunes for print magazines? A boost to bookstores? A return to big stereo systems in bedrooms? Don’t count it out.\n\nThis is going to cost parents a lot, but that’s another discussion.\n\n"},

He posted on the social media platform X that “several substations in the west now have electricity.”\n\nO Levy also said two thermoelectric power plants are back and two more will resume their operations “in the next few hours.”\n\n #Cuba   Proceso de Restauración SEN 🇨🇺Servidos en estos momentos 370 MW, es la suma de lo que tenemos en microsistemas.

The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, as services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps.\n\nThe blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst in two years, after a Category 3 hurricane damaged power installations and it took days for the government to fix them. This year, some homes have spent up to eight hours a day without electricity.\n\nBesides the Antonio Guiteras plant, whose failure on Friday affected the entire national system, Cuba has several others and it wasn’t immediately clear whether they remained functional.\n\nThere is no official estimate for when the blackout will end. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s collapse was massive.\n\nThe Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time.\n\nLocal authorities said the outage, which started on a small scale Thursday, stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse due to breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities.\n\nChanges to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered.\n\n"},

A couple of years ago, the Bishnoi gang really started to hit the airwaves and people (were) concerned about it … a lot of the diaspora know about Lawrence Bishnoi and his activities (in India).”\n\nOn Monday, the federal government expelled six Indian diplomats after the RCMP said it had credible evidence Indian agents played a role in crimes, including the killings of Canadian citizens and extortion.\n\n“What we’ve seen, from an RCMP perspective, is the use of organized crime elements and it’s been publicly attributed and claimed by one organized crime group in particular, which is the Bishnoi group,” said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin in a news conference Monday.\n\n“And we believe that group is connected to agents of the government of India.”\n\nIndia has insisted it hasn’t been given evidence of government involvement, and it ordered six Canadian diplomats to leave India.\n\nHeed said he can’t speculate about how the gang and diplomats might be involved in crimes, including the killing last year of activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, leader of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C.\n\nBut he said violent extortion cases connected to Bishnoi have been well documented by Canadian and Indian investigators in recent years.\n\nRitesh Lakhi agrees. The Indian journalist, who was a reporter for an ethnic B.C. radio show before moving to India, has covered the rise of the Bishnoi gang.\n\n“Bloodbaths involving Bishnoi gang members have been happening for years now in India,” Lakhi said in an interview.\n\n“Now this whole gang phenomenon has attracted global attention.”\n\nIn December 2023, police in Abbotsford, B.C., said they were investigating extortions involving affluent members of the South Asian community. They said suspects were believed to have ties to the Bishnoi.\n\nEarly this year, police in Ontario and Alberta said they were investigating similar extortion schemes, including some that saw bullets fired at businesses.\n\nHeed said he knows one B.C. businessman who lost $3 million because of threats from people who claimed to be members of the Bishnoi.\n\nThe National Investigation Agency, India’s counterterrorism law enforcement agency, said in 2023 that Lawrence Bishnoi operates his “terror-syndicate from jails in different states” in India and through an associate in Canada.\n\nLakhi said the gangster was born in the northern Indian state of Punjab and immersed himself in violence while studying law. He was involved in street fights and arsons with other student leaders over university politics.\n\nDuring one brawl, Lakhi said Bishnoi’s cousin was murdered and it’s believed Bishnoi shot the killer in revenge a year later.\n\nBishnoi also continued committing less serious crimes, including arsons and extortions, and was in and out of jail. Lakhi said he shared cells with notorious gang members and eventually took over a group that had lost its leader.\n\nBishnoi has been in jail since 2015, said Lakhi, and charges against him continue to pile up. Bishnoi is accused of orchestrating violent extortions while behind bars with a cellphone.\n\n“This can be construed to be one of the factors that gives credence to the theory that the Indian state may be protecting Lawrence Bishnoi,” Lakhi said.\n\nHe said Bishnoi has recently gained more notoriety by threatening to kill beloved Indian celebrities, political figures and business leaders.\n\nLakhi said the Bishnoi gang claimed responsibility last week in the shooting of a senior politician in India’s financial capital, Mumbai, before a key state election.\n\nIn 2022, Bishnoi was accused of being behind the violent shooting of Punjabi rapper Sidhu Moose Wala, who briefly lived in Canada.\n\nLakhi alleged Bishnoi had at that time already expanded his network into Canada, noting a brother of an ally in India had moved to B.C. and helped recruit vulnerable Indians.\n\nA 2021 court document says a student who was moving to Canada on a permit in 2017 requested refugee protection because he had been contacted and asked to join the gang and sell drugs.\n\nThe document says the student was beaten by Bishnoi gang members before he left for Canada. His application was denied.\n\nHeed said he has heard of other cases of Canadian gangsters with no connection to Bishnoi referencing the group because of the fear its name creates.\n\n“And now, the RCMP have raised (Bishnoi’s) profile significantly here in Canada,” he said.\n\n\n\n"},

But with no one waiting in the wings to chart a new course, there’s little that can be done.\n\n“They’re not happy, but they don’t have another choice,” he said.\n\n“The problem is, nobody is ready to replace Trudeau or want to replace Trudeau because they know they will lose. So it’s not very interesting running when you know you will suffer a very severe defeat.”\n\nTrudeau and the Liberals have spent more than a year in a double-digit polling deficit against Pierre Poilievre and his Conservative party, but Trudeau has repeatedly insisted he will lead the Liberals in the next federal election.\n\nA number of Liberal MPs have signed on to an internal document calling on Trudeau to step aside, which is expected to be raised at the next caucus meeting on Wednesday. Last week saw four more ministers tell Trudeau they won’t run for re-election, adding to a growing cabinet exodus and other MP resignations this year.\n\nThe Liberals in recent weeks also lost two key byelections in the Toronto and Montreal areas that they had held for years. The latter riding, LaSalle—Émard—Verdun, was narrowly won by the Bloc, whose fortunes appear on the rise.\n\nDuceppe said while the Conservatives have eaten away at Liberal votes in Quebec, Poilievre is also not well liked in the province, which has allowed the Bloc to ascend.\n\n“People don’t like that kind of style (of Poilievre’s, where) it is slogan after slogan without, I would say, any concrete measures to offer to people,” he said.\n\n“So the division of the vote plays in favour of the Bloc since the Francophones are supporting the Bloc.”\n\nThat electoral state-of-play in Quebec means a number of top Liberal MPs who could potentially succeed Trudeau are in tough races for re-election.\n\nOne such name being floated, Innovation and Science Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, is  currently projected to be in a dead heat  with the Bloc in his riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain — which includes the city of Shawinigan, the birthplace of former prime minister Jean Chretien.\n\n“Just imagine, he’d be losing Shawinigan while leading the Liberal party,” Duceppe said. “It could be a Kim Campbell second act.”\n\nDuceppe wouldn’t say if the Bloc’s popularity means renewed support for Quebec sovereignty, but noted it could become a bigger issue if the Parti Quebecois has a strong showing or even wins in the next provincial election slated for 2026.\n\n“There’s still two years, and two years in politics is a lot of time,” he said.\n\nThe Bloc, meanwhile, is making the most of the situation.\n\nAlthough the next federal election must occur by October 2025, the minority government could be toppled at any time after the NDP pulled out of a supply-and-confidence agreement in the summer.\n\nThe Liberals have survived two confidence motions so far. Yet Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet has said his party won’t support the government past the end of this month unless it gets support for its legislative priorities, including enhanced seniors benefits and supply management.\n\nDuceppe said Blanchet should “keep running like he’s doing and be honest with people” while pursuing concrete policies in Ottawa.\n\nAs for Trudeau, Duceppe said he may survive the current revolt from his caucus — but not the one that may be brewing from Canadian voters.\n\n“I don’t see (the Liberals) winning the next election,” he said. “Not at all.”\n\n"},

A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate.\n\nThe documents are attributed to the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  and  National Security Agency , and note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to  Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack  on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the “Five Eyes,” which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nThe documents, which are marked top secret, were posted to the Telegram messaging app and first reported Saturday by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said.\n\nThe U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of  Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar  and press for a cease-fire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand  military operations in the north in Lebanon  and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran’s missile attack go unanswered.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the leak of the two documents.\n\nThe documents first appeared online Friday via a channel on Telegram, claiming they had been leaked by someone in the U.S. intelligence community, then later the U.S. Defense Department. The information appeared entirely gathered through the use of satellite image analysis.\n\nOne of the two documents resembled the style of other material from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  leaked by Jack Teixeira , an Air National Guardsman who  pleaded guilty in March  to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on Ukraine and other national security secrets.\n\nThe Telegram channel involved in the leak identifies itself as being based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of Tehran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance,” which includes Middle East militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\n"},

The Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario said it was looking into the matter.\n\nHis brother, 37, got a job as a financial compliance officer at an international company in Richmond Hill, Ont. Property records show an Ameen Cohen bought a home in the city in 2022.\n\nResponding Friday to questions about the case, D’Amico said in a statement the province would be looking into ways to prevent those convicted of serious crimes from taking on new identities.\n\n“We will be exploring options to prohibit individuals guilty of serious Criminal Code offences and international sanctions violations, including terrorism-related crimes, from legally changing their names,” he said.\n\n“While we undertake this work, we also need the federal government to close gaps in the immigration system that allow individuals with criminal backgrounds and sanctions into Canada.”\n\nThe issue arose as Canada is using sanctions to contain Iran as it tries to destabilize the Middle East and lead an “axis of resistance” that includes terror groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthis.\n\nThe Immigration and Refugee Board was scheduled to begin a deportation hearing for Amin Yousefijam on Oct. 28, on the grounds he is a danger to the security of Canada.\n\nDetails about the brothers’ name changes were contained in hundreds of pages of public documents the Canada Border Services Agency entered as exhibits in the case.\n\nThe CBSA is arguing that, by illegally shipping sensitive manufacturing equipment to Iran, Amin Yousefijam undermined Canada’s efforts to contain the threat posed by the regime.\n\nHe contributed to “an increased security threat towards Canada in regards to terrorism and attack by nuclear weapons,” CBSA wrote in its report.\n\n“Mr. Yousefijam’s activities directly compromised the efforts of the Canadian government with respect to its foreign policy goals vis-a-vis Iran.”\n\nAlthough his lawyers tried to ban the press from his deportation hearing, Global News fought the application and won. They declined to comment. Nor did Arash Yousefijam respond to questions.\n\nBut in an earlier phone call, he described his U.S. conviction for sanctions evasion as “just some legal issues that I had,” and said the brothers changed their names because “we want to start a new life.”\n\nOntario court records show that CIBC filed a law suit against him on July 11, alleging he owed them for a $358,006 personal line of credit and had failed to make the minimum payments.\n\nAccording to a  report released this week , Canada has become an “appealing target” for procurement networks that help Iran evade international sanctions.\n\n“Canada’s approach towards Iran and its proxies showcases both vigilance and inconsistencies,” said the report by the George Washington University’s Program on Extremism.\n\n“On one hand, the country has implemented robust measures, including designating Iran as a state supporter of terrorism and imposing significant sanctions on numerous Iranian individuals and entities.”\n\n“However, the persistent presence of high-level individuals and the influence of Iranian networks within the country reveal a certain degree of permissiveness,” said the report, Propaganda, Procurement and Lethal Operations: Iran’s Activities Inside America.\n\nThe Yousefijams immigrated to Canada from Iran.

What this means for you", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe legislation, part of the now-defunct political agreement between the Liberals and the NDP, establishes a framework for the creation of any future universal pharmacare plan.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10807237/canada-pharmacare-plan-what-to-know/", "article": "Canada’s  pharmacare  bill has officially become a reality after it officially passed through the Senate Thursday and received royal assent.\n\nThat means many will soon have access to more medications, including those for diabetes and contraception, which are deemed essential and can cost hundreds or thousands out of pocket each year, though specific provincial agreements are still in negotiation.\n\nThe legislation, part of the now-defunct political agreement between the Liberals and the NDP, establishes a framework for the creation of any future universal pharmacare plan.\n\n“Today is about pharmacare. It is an incredibly important day for this country,” Health Minister Mark Holland said during a Friday media briefing. “I am not going to say this was easy…. Getting this bill adopted through the House and the Senate was incredibly difficult.”\n\nNow that Bill C-64 is law, the pharmacare plan will provide coverage for certain diabetes treatments and contraception in provinces that reach agreements with the federal government.\n\nThese agreements will support reproductive freedom by providing up to nine million women and gender diverse people in Canada free access to contraception, Holland says.\n\nAdditionally, the 3.7 million people in Canada living with diabetes will have universal access to a suite of medications that reduce the risk of serious health complications and improve quality of life,  the government said .\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the bill.\n\nThe pharmacare legislation includes universal access to contraception and diabetes medications, with the goal to expand the number of covered medications in the future.\n\nIt also implements a universal first-dollar coverage pharmacare plan for medications, meaning that the government pays the costs upfront.\n\nThe diabetes medications covered include first-line treatments that lower blood glucose levels, providing Canadians with access to essential therapies such as:\n\nYou can find a  full list of the covered diabetes medication  on the government of Canada’s website.\n\nThe bill also covers access to contraceptives for roughly nine million Canadians of reproductive age.\n\n“Contraceptive drugs were chosen as part of this next step of universal pharmacare specifically because improved access to contraception improves equality. It reduces the risk of unintended pregnancies and improves reproductive rights,”  Health Canada stated in a February media release .\n\nThe contraception coverage includes oral contraceptives, copper and hormonal IUDs, injections, implants, rings and morning-after pills.\n\nFind a  full list of the covered contraceptive medication  on the government of Canada’s website.\n\nNow that the bill has become law, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged provinces and territories to begin negotiating pharmacare deals as soon as possible. This includes payment and distribution\n\nThis is essential for implementing the plan, as the federal government must negotiate and sign agreements with the provinces and territories across the country.\n\n“This is real progress, but now we need the provinces and territories to come to the table and sign agreements with us that supports Canadians and takes pressure off their household budgets as soon as possible,” Trudeau told reporters on Friday.\n\nBritish Columbia has already signed a  memorandum of understanding  to provide coverage for residents, though that coverage looks a bit different in B.C. than it likely will for others.\n\nThe federal coverage is for birth control and diabetes drugs and supplies, but B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said oral contraceptives are already covered under a provincial program so that share of funding will be used to cover the cost of hormone replacement therapy for women.\n\n Hormone therapy  is a medical treatment used to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness and in some cases, to prevent osteoporosis. It contains hormones that the ovaries make less of as women age and reach menopause.\n\nSome provinces are opposed to the federal plan, as both  Alberta  and Quebec have expressed their intention to opt out of pharmacare if it is enacted.\n\nInstead, they plan to invest their share of the program’s funding into their own health-care systems.\n\nHolland hopes this will change.\n\n“It is ideal that everyone is on the same page … but we need more conversations to get there,” Holland said Friday, acknowledging that negotiating with provinces and territories may take some time; however, he expressed hope that all provinces and territories will be on board by next spring.\n\nThe 2024 federal  budget reported  the first phase of national pharmacare would cost $1.5 billion over five years, starting in 2024-25.\n\n The Parliamentary Budget Office  (PBO) estimates total drug expenditures under pharmacare to be $33.2 billion in 2024-25 (the assumed first full fiscal year of implementation), increasing to $38.9 billion in 2027-28.\n\n“After accounting for status quo spending on provincial drug plans and direct federal spending, as well as Pharmacare copayment revenues, the incremental cost to the public sector (that is federal and provincial governments combined) is estimated to be $11.2 billion in 2024-25, increasing to $13.4 billion in 2027-28,” the PBO stated.\n\nThe PBO estimates cost savings on drug expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2024-25, with that figure increasing to $2.2 billion by 2027-28.\n\nHolland has said this is the first step in its plan to establish a universal pharmacare system across Canada.\n\nWithin the next month, Ottawa is set to convene an expert panel to investigate the next steps in establishing a full-fledged pharmacare program.\n\nThe committee will report its recommendations to the health minister within a year as the legislation will inform the creation of any future universal pharmacare plan.\n\n\n\n"},

Upon closer inspection, the filmmakers discovered a sock still in the boot, with the foot inside, branded with an embroidered stitch reading, “A.C. Irvine.”\n\nImmediately, the National Geographic documentary team said they realized this was no ordinary boot. They believe it belonged to English mountaineer Andrew Comyn “Sandy” Irvine, who attempted to reach Everest’s summit with his climbing partner George Mallory in June 1924.\n\nIrvine, 22, and Mallory, 38, may have been the first people to summit Everest, though it has so far been impossible to determine, since the duo never returned.\n\nSince then, the mystery has fascinated people both inside and out of the international mountaineering community. Much of the fascination has had to do with a camera carried by Irvine during the trek, which could potentially hold undeveloped film to prove whether he and Mallory reached the summit.\n\nPhotographer and director Jimmy Chin told National Geographic that discovery of the foot had his team “all  literally running in circles  dropping F-bombs.”\n\nHe speculated the boot had only melted out of the ice about a week or so prior to its discovery.\n\nThe remains were being disturbed by ravens, Chin said, so his team asked permission from the China-Tibet Mountaineering Association to carry the foot and boot down the mountain in a cooler.\n\nThough the team cannot yet say for certain whether the remains belong to Irvine, Chin is confident.\n\n“But I mean, dude,” he said. “There’s a label on it.”\n\nChin contacted living relatives of Irvine to share the news.\n\nJulie Summers, 64, said the foot and boot “tells the whole story about what probably happened.”\n\nSummers, who wrote a biography about her great-uncle, told National Geographic the discovery is a form of closure. She speculated Irvine’s remains may have been carried down Everest by avalanches, and later crushed by the moving glacier.\n\nThe foot will be DNA-tested and compared to samples provided by Irvine’s living family members.\n\nPrior to the discovery of the boot, Chin said his team identified an oxygen bottle bearing the date 1933. That year, an expedition of climbers discovered an ice axe that had belonged to Irvine.\n\nChin and his team have not disclosed where exactly the remains were found in an attempt to dissuade others from searching for trophies.\n\nMallory’s remains were discovered in 1999. His body had a broken leg and showed signs of deep rope lacerations, meaning he likely suffered a fall. Many believe Irvine would have fallen with him, as it is common practice for climbers to tie to one another.\n\nMallory had reportedly carried a photo of his wife while climbing Everest, which he planned to leave at the summit. The photo was not on his person, and his snow goggles were in his pocket, leading some to believe he and Irvine had indeed been successful on their ascent.\n\nBefore now, there was no trace of Irvine.\n\nIrvine and Mallory attempted to reach Everest’s summit 29 years before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed to the top. Hillary, an explorer from New Zealand, and Norgay, a Sherpa mountaineer from Nepal, are the first two people known to have reached Everest’s summit.\n\n"},

U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris, who’s running against Trump in November’s election, has also said she intends to review the pact.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Laos at the end of this week’s ASEAN Summit, Trudeau said his government will continue to defend Canadian workers and industries as it did during the tense negotiations with the first Trump administration that led to CUSMA, often referred to as the “new  NAFTA .”\n\n“We’ve been here before,” Trudeau said.\n\nHe said Canada has “bucked the trend” of countries turning away from international free trade deals toward more protectionist and “insular” economic strategies by successfully negotiating agreements with Europe and Asian partners, as well as CUSMA.\n\n“We did it by standing up for Canadian jobs, by demonstrating how integrated, in the case of the United States, our economies already are. We’re ready to do it again if necessary.”\n\nCUSMA, known as the USMCA in the U.S., replaced the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) when it came into force in 2020 — putting it up for review in 2026. All three countries will have to confirm in writing if they wish to extend or renegotiate the agreement.\n\nDuring his speech in Detroit, Trump announced that “upon taking office, I will formally inform Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provisions of the USMCA that I put in.”\n\n“Oh, I’m going to have a lot of fun,” he added.\n\nMuch of Trump’s speech was focused on the U.S. auto industry, which is largely based in Detroit. He suggested he wants to add new clauses to CUSMA that will stop Chinese auto companies from building plants in Mexico and benefitting from Mexico’s access to the U.S. vehicle market.\n\nCUSMA’s rules of origin clause requires higher levels of North American parts in vehicles sold in the three countries compared with NAFTA, which Trump said China is also trying to exploit.\n\n“I’ll also seek strong new protections against transshipment, so that China and other countries cannot smuggle their products into the United States tax-free through Mexico to the detriment of our workers and our supply chains,” Trump said.\n\n“They smuggle this stuff in. They don’t pay anything. We’re going to have very strong language on that.”\n\nChinese automaker BYD  has become a top vehicle supplier to Mexico  and is reportedly planning to build its next auto plant in the country, although  Bloomberg reported the company is waiting  until after the U.S. election to make a final decision.\n\nTrump vowed to impose “whatever tariffs are required” to keep Chinese auto plants out of Mexico — even suggesting levies as high as 1,000 per cent on those companies.\n\n“I don’t want to see them,” he said.\n\nTrump didn’t mention any grievances he has with Canada during his speech. But Canada, which briefly faced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum during the NAFTA negotiations, is bracing for Trump’s vow of across-the-board tariffs on all foreign imports between 10 and 20 per cent — an act that  economists say could throw Canada into a recession. \n\nHarris has blamed CUSMA, which she calls “Trump’s trade deal,” for a loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs during Trump’s presidency. She has also pointed to  the United Auto Workers union’s claim  that Stellantis, a top auto manufacturer, is seeking to move some production from the U.S. to Canada — a claim Stellantis has denied — which Harris said was made “far too easy” through CUSMA.\n\nHarris, who was one of just 10 U.S. senators who voted against CUSMA, said in a statement last month that she would reopen the agreement as president.\n\n“Many who voted for this deal conditioned their support on a review process, which, as president, I will use,” she wrote.\n\nAlthough Harris said she “knew it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers” when she voted against CUSMA in 2020, she said at the time that her decision was based on “insufficient” environmental provisions.\n\nThe offices of Canada’s chief economist and U.S. trade representative have both said CUSMA has had a positive impact on their countries’ respective economies, particularly in the automotive sector.\n\nKimberly Clausing, an economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Global News that while both Trump and Harris are making big claims about CUSMA on the campaign trail, they may think twice upon taking office.\n\n“If you’re going to expend political capital to do international economic things, you should try to be more bold and do things with more substance, rather than tinkering with an agreement that’s basically working,” she said.\n\nClausing also echoed Trudeau’s point that CUSMA drew strong bipartisan support at the time, despite Harris’s opposition.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything that’s happened in the time since that would really make one rethink that,” Clausing said.\n\n"},

During that time, CSIS agents grew frustrated with what they perceived as a delay by the minister’s office in the investigation into  Michael Chan , a former Ontario Liberal cabinet minister.\n\nOver multiple days of testimony at the  foreign interference  inquiry — including Blair, his former chief of staff, Zita Astravas, and high-ranking CSIS officials — it is still not clear why this warrant took significantly longer than most CSIS requests to the minister.\n\nBut Blair, now the defence minister, testified Friday morning that politics was not behind the delay in approving the surveillance, which was eventually approved just months before the 2021 federal election.\n\n“When this warrant application was put before me, I never considered anything else other than my statutory responsibility to review and if appropriate approve the warrant,” Blair, who said he signed off on the warrant the same day he was given it, told the commission.\n\n“There was no other consideration and certainly no political considerations.”\n\nThree weeks after Blair signed off on the warrant, a Federal Court judge approved CSIS’s request to investigate Chan.\n\nMedia reports identified Chan as being under suspicion of working with the Chinese government going back as far as 2015, when Astravas worked in Premier Kathleen Wynne’s office as director of media relations and Chan was a sitting cabinet minister.\n\n“Michael Chan is a man of sterling character who has served the people of Markham-Unionville, and all Ontarians, honourably,” Astravas told the Globe and Mail, which first reported CSIS interest in Chan, in June 2015.\n\nChan, now the deputy mayor of Markham, is currently suing CSIS and two reporters, including a former Global News employee, over leaks and news articles.\n\nThe delay with this particular warrant has become a central narrative in the second phase of Justice Marie-Josée Hogue’s public inquiry, in much the same way “irregularities” around Han Dong’s 2019 Liberal nomination in Don Valley North dominated the first phase.\n\nThe 2019 nomination story focused on how the People’s Republic of China (PRC) allegedly interferes in Canadian democracy. The questions concerning the Chan warrant have more to do with how the federal government responds when they have allegations of foreign interference.\n\nThe warrant was delivered to the minister’s office in the midst of the global pandemic, and both Blair and Astravas testified that access to CSIS intelligence was significantly curtailed while people were still working from home.\n\nNevertheless, Astravas was given a briefing on the warrant from CSIS officials 13 days after the warrant was submitted for approval, and a second briefing in the following weeks. In testimony on Wednesday, Astravas rejected the assertion that she wanted to “slow walk” the file because it would bring CSIS into the affairs of her party as “categorically false.”\n\nWhile CSIS operatives and officials may have been frustrated with the delay, former CSIS director David Vigneault previously told the commission that he was not concerned with the warrant’s timeline.\n\nBlair testified Friday that Vigneault never expressed concerns about “delays” — although the former CSIS director did brief him about concerns surrounding Chan’s activity months before the warrant was prepared.\n\n“But I do understand … that it’s important that a document you present to the Federal Court judge for approval would have to be complete and contemporaneous to the application. So I understand the concern but I have no knowledge of a delay,” Blair said.\n\n“When the matter was brought to my attention, I dealt with it very expeditiously and promptly, and at no time did the director of CSIS or the deputy minister (of Public Safety) or my chief of staff ever suggest to me any concern with this issue of delay, with the interval to complete this.”\n\nThe second phase of testimony at the Hogue commission is scheduled to wrap up next week, when senior officials from the Prime Minister’s Office — including Chief of Staff Katie Telford — will testify for a second time on Tuesday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is scheduled to take the stand on Wednesday.\n\nAfter that, Hogue and her team of lawyers will have less than 11 weeks to draft their final report, including recommendations to better safeguard Canadian democracy from foreign meddling.\n\n"},

Many blame the cost of living, but the issues are complex.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10807747/canada-parental-benefits-fertility-rate/", "article": "Vancouver mom Chelsea Heney waited until the age of 40 to have her first baby last November.\n\nWhile wanting to be financially prepared was a “big factor” in putting off motherhood, concerns about her relationships, health and career also influenced her decision to wait.\n\n“For me, having children was always something I knew I wanted, but was, increasingly as I got older, something I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to do with respect to age, feeling financially secure,” she told Global News in an interview.\n\nBecoming a mom to her son Olivier has certainly been a fulfilling experience, but Heney says it has come with a “financial toll,” especially since she was laid off during her maternity leave.\n\n“It’s definitely a gut punch,” Heney said.\n\n“I think there’s a financial toll that you take when you have children and especially in my situation, where a job that I thought I was going… to go back to was not there and not available to me.”\n\nWhile she looks for another job, Heney has filed a human rights complaint against her company over her layoff.\n\n“It’s really unfortunate that, as working women, we don’t have protections that we should in coming back to and being able to take maternity leaves, have children and then coming back to the workplace,” she said.\n\nHeney is among many Canadians who have put off parenthood for financial or other reasons.\n\n In a new Angus Reid survey  released on Thursday, more than half of potential parents said they have delayed having children longer than they ideally would have liked, and this is largely due to the rising cost of living and other financial concerns.\n\n“I think cost of living has become top of mind for a lot of people and kids are expensive,” said Allison Venditti, founder of Moms at Work, an advocacy group that supports working mothers.\n\nAccording to the Angus Reid poll, four in 10 (41 per cent) said that the delay was because of concerns about the job market and financial security.\n\nOne-third (33 per cent) are also worry about the cost and availability of childcare and a similar proportion (31 per cent) have concerns about the housing market.\n\nMarina Adshade, assistant professor of teaching at the University of British Columbia’s Vancouver School of Economics, told Global News the concerns of potential parents are not just about the availability or even affordability of childcare but their ability to work and have children — especially for potential mothers.\n\n“I think it’s particularly creating barriers for women who spend a lot of time in school, spend a lot of time investing in their career, want to have children, but then are looking at our current system and saying, ‘Can I have children, raise them the way that I want to raise them and still invest in my career?'” Adshade said.\n\nFor others, the timing isn’t right (26 per cent) or they just haven’t found the right partner yet (40 per cent).\n\nFour in 10 also said they will “definitely” not have or raise a kid in the future. The Angus Reid poll was conducted last month and included 1,300 Canadian adults.\n\nIt  follows the news last month from Statistics Canada  that Canada’s fertility rate, which has been steadily declining, has hit a record low and the country is now among the “lowest-low” fertility nations.\n\n A StatCan report published in January  said Canada, like other countries, is riding the “fertility ‘pandemic rollercoaster’” with more families putting off having children.\n\n“Given the COVID-19 pandemic initiated a period of public health crisis, as well as economic and societal shocks, it is possible that a segment of the population responded to this period of widespread uncertainty via their childbearing choices,” it read.\n\nDon Kerr, a demographer at King’s University College at Western University in London, Ont., said it’s a challenge to raise a country’s birth rate once it falls.\n\nBut Kerr added that government measures like increasing Employment Insurance benefits for maternity and paternity could help ease off some of the financial concerns that are holding Canadians back from having kids.\n\nIn Canada,  those on maternity and parental leave  get Employment Insurance benefits of up to 55 per cent of their salary, with a maximum weekly pay of up to $668, which is taxed.\n\nThe birth parent is eligible for maternity leave for the first 15 weeks after the birth of a child. After that, it switches to parental leave, with up to 40 weeks that can be shared between both parents.\n\nParents are also eligible for extended benefits up to 61 weeks for one parent and 69 weeks shared between both. In that case, they get up to 33 per cent of their pay and a maximum of $401 weekly.\n\nAny money earned while on parental leave sees those benefits clawed back.\n\nExperts say this money is not enough.\n\nThat’s a major cut for a lot of young couples who are trying to pay the rent, the bills,” Kerr said. “It’s not particularly generous.”\n\nVenditti said the maximum amount of salary that parents use is just over $60,000, which is also taxed, and for people who are making more than that, “it’s a huge chunk of change to lose.”\n\nLisa Wolff, UNICEF Canada director of policy and research, told Global News the delay to parenthood isn’t a surprise in part because parental leave has become what she considers a “highly inequitable policy.”\n\n“We have to look at it differently and look at it more as an entitlement for infants to have that freedom from poverty and access to care that their parents want to provide right from the start and get them off to the best start in life so we can be more inclusive with parental leave,” she said.\n\nFrance, which saw the lowest number of births since World War Two last year,  is planning to overhaul its parental benefits  program so that it pays better.\n\nParents in Croatia are entitled to full pay from the Croatian Health Insurance Fund if they’ve paid into social security for at least nine consecutive months, with those that didn’t pay in still eligible for 70 per cent of the “budget base.”\n\nNew Zealand also provides weekly parental leave payments at 100 per cent of either your ordinary weekly pay or average weekly earnings at 100 per cent up, whichever is greater, to a maximum amount of $754.87 gross pay per week.\n\nIncreasing the parental leave benefits in Canada would make a “huge difference” in easing some of the financial pressures parents are facing, Venditti said, adding that’s only one part of the reform needed.\n\n“It’s very unlikely that we’ll be able to buy our way out of this problem,” Adshade said. “First of all, it would be phenomenally expensive. The second thing is, there’s no money in the world that will make somebody who doesn’t want children to want children.”\n\nPolicies that allow working for a limited time period during parental leave could also go a long way in helping boost income without having to raise EI, Venditti said.\n\nShe pointed to example of the United Kingdom’s  “keeping in touch days”  when some employees can work up to 20 paid days during maternity and paternity leave without losing any of their benefits.\n\nIn Canada, the federal government has been consulting for years on how to  modernize the Employment Insurance (EI) program  so it better meets the needs of workers and employers.\n\nBut there’s been little indication so far of what measures could be on the table.\n\nMoms at Work was among dozens of organizations and stakeholders who were consulted by the federal government regarding the program in 2021 and 2022.\n\n“The federal government is looking at adjusting and changing parental leave benefits, so making them more accessible to both parents, looking at the wage rate, looking at options for self-employed people or people who are contractors, which is a very big shift,” Venditti said.\n\nEmployment and Social Development Canada told Global News that the government has made “several important changes” since 2017 to the EI program that gives working parents more flexibility.\n\n“The Government of Canada recognizes that balancing family, work, and financial considerations is a challenging task for Canadians raising young children, and that each family has its own needs,” Samuelle Carbonneau, an ESDC spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Office of the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development Randy Boissonnault  told Global News in January  that the government was not specifically looking to increase parental leave pay, but said it was an ongoing process of improvement.\n\nThe corporate sector also has a role to play in offering employees better compensation when they are on parental leave, Venditti said.\n\n In a survey by Maturn and The Brand is Female  released earlier this year, 70 per cent of employed mothers said they don’t feel they have adequate support from their employers.\n\nNearly 40 per cent of working women said that they did not receive a maternity leave top-up from their employer and 59 per cent of those who did were not offered other benefits such as coaching programs, counselling or child-care assistance.\n\nStatistics Canada data shows that 55.7 per cent of employed women of child-bearing age reported that they had access to employer-provided maternity or parental benefits in 2022.\n\nFewer men (51.8 per cent) said they had access to parental benefits through their employer, according to  StatCan’s report from June 2023. \n\nVenditti said company top-ups are still not as common in Canada as they should be.\n\n“This is not a huge investment for companies to make if they want to encourage people to stay and feel more confident in having children,” she said.\n\nHeney’s company was giving her an 80 per cent top-up to the EI benefits. But now that she’s laid off, she says the parental EI benefits from the government are “not enough to live on.”\n\nShe and her partner are having to dip into their savings to afford childcare and meet other expenses.\n\nHeney said the fact that paternal benefits are given from the same pool of money and at the same rate as someone who has lost their job in the case of being laid off, shows that the government  “doesn’t value the work” of parents.\n\n“It’s hard work raising children and I think we need to do a better job of of putting a value against that,” she said.\n\n"},

But a series of deals and savvy draft picks in 2024 remade the entire Toronto roster, including renewed depth at the guard positions.\n\nGradey Dick was selected 13th overall in the 2023 NBA Draft and has grown into the Raptors’ presumptive starting shooting guard. A trade with the New York Knicks last December brought Immanuel Quickley over to become Toronto’s go-to point guard, then a draft-day deal on June 27 brought Davion Mitchell from the Sacramento Kings to Toronto as his backup.\n\nJa’Kobe Walter — who can play the one or two-guard — was taken 19th overall in this summer’s NBA Draft and Jamal Shead was taken 45th overall using a pick acquired from the Kings as part of the Mitchell deal.\n\nThat class of young guards — Mitchell is the oldest at 26 — means the Raptors will be able to apply constant pressure on anyone playing the perimeter.\n\n“That was one of the main reasons they drafted me and it was being preached all training camp,” said Shead, who flew all over the court on Sunday in Toronto’s first pre-season game. “(Head coach Darko Rajakovic) just told us to just play as hard as we can ball pressure and just try to give 100 per cent every place.\n\n“So I tried to do that.”\n\nShead had 10 points and combined with Mitchell for nine assists and one turnover with Quickley (thumb) out in the Raptors’ 125-89 pre-season victory over the Washington Wizards at Montreal’s Bell Centre.\n\nThe 22-year-old Shead, who averaged 12.9 points, 6.3 assists, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.2 steals per game in his fourth U.S. collegiate season at Houston, said it’s “pretty exciting” when he can disrupt another team’s offence.\n\n“When I can get the other team to foul me and get an offensive foul, I think that really gets the crowd and my teammates going,” he said.\n\nThe Raptors played the Wizards again on Friday night, this time in Washington, D.C. Although Quickley participated in a full practice on Thursday, he was not available for the game. Walter remained out with a sprained shoulder.\n\nAll-star forward Scottie Barnes was scheduled to play against the Wizards on Friday for his first in-game action since March 1, said that the pressure Mitchell and Shead bring to the ball would make his job easier as a weakside defender.\n\n“You just get easy blocks if (opponents) get past them,” said Barnes. “It just helps our defence overall with them guarding the ball, pushing that full court.\n\n“Those guys, they come into practice every single day, and you know what to expect out of those guys.”\n\nRajakovic said on Wednesday that he likes what he’s seen from Shead so far this pre-season.\n\n“Competitiveness, winning spirit, dedication, attention to detail, a lot of stuff he already has,” said Rajakovic after a practice at the OVO Athletic Centre. “He needs to learn the league, he needs to be in elite shape.\n\n“When he does that I think he is a player I think who has a great future in this league.”\n\nMitchell has averaged 7.4 points, 2.8 assists, 1.6 rebounds and 0.5 steals over his three NBA seasons, all in Sacramento. As a rotation player, Mitchell was only a starter for the Kings 32 times but appeared in 227 games.\n\nHis career numbers improve considerably when looked at per 100 possessions: 17.6 points, 6.6 assists, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.2 steals.\n\nShead said that having to practise against Mitchell has been like iron sharpening iron. Because Mitchell is such an intense defender, it has prepared the NBA rookie for the speed of the professional game.\n\n“When Davion is guarding you, it is really hard,” said Shead after the pre-season win in Montreal. “I tried to slow down a little bit today, but with him not in front of me, everything kind of opened up.\n\n“I was just trying to play as hard as I can, and that just eventually ended up me running a lot, so the speed wasn’t really the problem. I think just not having Davion in front of me was really the best thing for me today.”\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 11, 2024.\n\n"},

He saw them set up a trap and three webcams where a moose had been killed.\n\n“When I saw that, I thought, ‘Yeah, I can do that,’” he said.\n\nCantil set up a low-tech camera, and caught his first animal on it, a wolverine, fueling a passion that led to the creation of the Facebook page in 2017.\n\nThen, while hiking, he met Shaw, a retired science education professor and associate dean of the College of Education at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\nShaw was intrigued by his game cameras and began bugging him to see the footage.\n\n“Well, he finally got tired of me pestering him and one day he said, ‘You know, you can get your own camera,’ and so that started my hobby,” said Shaw, a native of Texas.\n\nShe started by strapping a single $60 camera to a tree. Now she has nine cameras, seven of which are active in Far North Bicentennial Park, a 4,000-acre (1,619-hectare) park stretching for miles along the front range of the Chugach Mountains on the east side of Anchorage.\n\nHer cameras are set up anywhere between a quarter-mile to a half-mile (402 meters to 804 meters) of the Chugach Foothills neighborhood and she frequently posts to the Facebook group page.\n\nCantil also posts videos from his three cameras.\n\n“I knew there was wildlife out here because I would occasionally run into a moose or a bear on the trail, but I didn’t know how much wildlife was out here until I put the cameras on it,” Shaw said.\n\nShe replaces batteries and storage cards about once a week, walking into the woods to do so armed with an air horn to announce her presence, two cans of bear spray and a .44-caliber handgun for protection.\n\nMany of the page’s followers are Anchorage residents looking for information about which animals may currently be roaming around the popular trail system. Other users join to see what the cameras capture, including people from other states who “enjoy looking at the wildlife that we have here,” she said.\n\nShaw said that every few years, her cameras catch a wolf or two — and sometimes even a pack. This year she was surprised when a pack of five wolves came by, walking quietly in a single file.\n\nLast month, while she collected memory cards, she saw moose fur on the ground across the creek from two of her cameras. After she spotted what looked like a roughed-up patch of dirt where a bear might bury its kill, she assumed it was another moose attacked by a black bear, similar to what happened earlier not too far away.\n\nBut when she checked the memory card, it instead showed the wolves taking down the moose yearling as the moose’s mother attempted to protect her offspring by trying to kick the wolves away with her long legs.\n\nNow, the demand for the page is growing, but Shaw said she’s done adding cameras.\n\n“I think I’m at my camera max,” she said. “Nine is enough!”\n\n"},

I think the same thing can be said in the way we bring the game to life for people watching on TV,” Messier said on a call from Toronto.\n\n“The technology’s changing all the time — sophistication in cameras, ideas of how we bring and immerse the fans into the game have all changed.\n\n“You have to be willing to change in order to keep up.”\n\n broadcasts will include Rapid Recap, an interactive feature where those who join a game in progress can watch a two-minute highlight package compiled with artificial intelligence.\n\nMark Shopiro, head of Prime Video Canada, said more innovations will be introduced throughout the season, but the current focus is “getting the broadcast right and giving a great product to fans.”\n\nAmazon acquired the rights to broadcast all national, regular-season Monday night NHL games for the next two seasons through a deal with Rogers. The move has fuelled speculation that Amazon will bid for the Canadian broadcasting rights to all NHL games when they become available after the 2025-26 season.\n\n“If someone thinks that two years from now, Amazon – which is this gigantic company that’s clearly very bullish about making an imprint in the sports world – will say, ‘We’re just going to do this for two years, just dabble and see where it goes and then go away,’ I would be stunned, quite honestly,” said Adnan Virk, who will co-host  with Andi Petrillo.\n\n“I cannot imagine how they wouldn’t be a part of the package.”\n\nWhen asked about the NHL broadcasting rights, Shopiro said he “can’t speculate on future deals.”\n\nA Rogers spokesperson said the Canadian media giant plans “to be at the table” when the NHL rights come up for renewal, but wouldn’t comment further.\n\nNHL’s chief content officer and executive vice-president Steve Mayer couldn’t speak to the upcoming negotiations, but said “we hope this is a long relationship at the NHL with Amazon and obviously, we’re just starting things off with these two years.”\n\nRogers’ Sportsnet will continue to broadcast national games on Wednesdays for the next two years, along with  on Saturdays, also available on CBC and other Rogers-owned channels.\n\nOne observer said the NHL is the biggest winner in the Amazon-Rogers deal because the price for the broadcast rights has now been “driven up,” adding that hockey fans are the biggest losers.\n\n“You’re forcing your current subscribers to subscribe somewhere else. If you want to watch national Monday night games, you have to have Amazon Prime,” Toronto Metropolitan University sport media professor Laurel Walzak said.\n\n“Now, instead of paying the subscription fee for Sportsnet, you’re also paying a subscription fee for Amazon Prime. So the fan is paying double.”\n\nShe said this speaks to a larger trend in sports, where leagues are now signing rights deals with multiple parties.\n\nIn July, the NBA inked an 11-year agreement with Disney, NBC and Amazon.\n\nPetrillo, who has worked for CBC and TSN, said she understands why there might be some backlash to the NHL’s move to streaming.\n\n“I know exactly where people are coming from when you get so used to something for your entire life — channel surfing, sitting down and just wanting to subscribe to one thing and have everything on that,” said Petrillo, who will also host a Prime show on Thursdays called , featuring highlights, analysis and interviews.\n\n“But the habits of people are dictating where the industry is going. And more and more people have cut the cord. They’re going the way of streaming … We’re going where they are.”\n\nAmazon hopes to hook hockey fans with top-shelf broadcasts, using 30 HD cameras per episode that film in high dynamic range at 60 frames per second.\n\n“I think the technology and advancement in cameras and angles, being able to put cameras in different positions than we’ve ever been able to in the past, is really going to elevate the experience,” said Messier, who joins a team of analysts including Blake Bolden, Thomas Hickey, Shane Hnidy and Jody Shelley.\n\nVirk said  will lean harder into statistics than most hockey shows.\n\n“We’re going to use numbers in a way that will differentiate it from other broadcasts. We’ll use more analytics,” he said.\n\n“I don’t mean to disparage any of the other broadcasts, but I think this Amazon broadcast will be very smart and (geared) towards educated hockey fans.”\n\nWhat’s more, he said the show’s theme song, recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, is “a banger.”\n\n“I’ll tell you right now, (as someone who) grew up on the ‘Hockey Night in Canada’ theme, the music alone will have people paying attention.”\n\n"},

She tells Global News that her customers are fond of Porter because the lack of a middle seat is a boon for those with mobility concerns, and serving drinks in real glassware adds a touch of class to the experience, harkening back to the early days of flying.\n\n“Everyone is talking about it because the service is completely different than any other airline product in Canada and North America,” Deluce says.\n\nInternal customer satisfaction surveys rank the airline highly, he tells Global News, and a focus on hospitality also seems to bear fruit on the regulatory side.\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Agency’s most recent tracking of customer complaints ranks Porter at the lowest among its competitors.\n\nPer 100 flights, Porter averaged 1.3 complaints from April 2023 through to June 2024, according to the transportation watchdog. Air Canada and WestJet averaged around five complaints per 100 flights in the same period; the now-defunct Lynx Air topped the list of gripes with 18.9, while Edmonton’s Flair Airlines was second from top at 15.0.\n\nPorter’s competitors also appear to be taking notice of the airline.\n\nIn June, Air Canada announced it would also  offer complimentary alcoholic beverages  on its flights, while a month later  WestJet said it would soon open up free Wi-Fi  on some of its routes. (These moves did not escape Porter’s notice, each earning  tongue-in-cheek kudos  from the challenger airline  on social media .)\n\nPorter is looking to compete not only on quality, but also on quantity.\n\nIn the past 18 months, Porter added 36 North American destinations to its offerings and deployed 42 brand-new narrow-body jets, with plans to scale up to 100 aircraft in the years ahead.\n\nDeluce says Porter has hired an extra 2,500 staff in the past year and a half as part of its efforts to scale up and compete more directly with the established, large players, particularly Air Canada in the east.\n\nComparing this year’s Thanksgiving weekend offerings with 2023, Porter’s seat capacity is up 37 per cent, according to data shared with Global News from aviation analytics firm Cirium. Despite the collapse of Lynx in February and WestJet’s absorption of Swoop, overall flight capacity was up year over year over Thanksgiving, thanks largely to Porter’s expansion.\n\nMuch of Porter’s growth has come from its hub, Billy Bishop Airport on the island in Toronto.\n\nThe airline received some clarity this week from Toronto city council, which voted to approve extending the airport’s lease arrangement for another two decades despite concerns from municipal staff.\n\nNext, Porter plans to build a new terminal at Montreal Metropolitan Airport near the downtown core as part of a bid to revitalize the land into, in Deluce’s words, “Billy Bishop on steroids.” That expansion is set to open sometime in the second half of 2025.\n\nPorter was one of a select few to shut down completely during the COVID-19 pandemic amid the collapse of business travel, previously the airline’s bread and butter.\n\nBut Deluce says that decision has paid off in the pandemic recovery as Canadians’ appetite for travel surged back.\n\nRather than “scrambling day to day,” going dark during the pandemic gave the Porter the “clarity of thought” to chart a path out of the pandemic slump while its competitors struggled to keep planes in the air.\n\nPorter also secured a $270.5-million loan from the federal government in 2021 to help eventually get its planes back into the air and refund passengers for cancelled flights. Air Canada was meanwhile approved for up to $5.9 billion in assistance, while WestJet did not move forward with the relief program.\n\n“It allowed us to preserve our balance sheet and focus on the future,” Deluce says of the decision to shutter during the pandemic.\n\nWhile Porter has been on the scene since 2006, the recent rapid expansion puts it in a similar position to a startup airline, Kokonis notes.\n\nFlying brand-new planes — not to mention the infrastructure investments the airline is making in Montreal — is a “cash flow-intensive” endeavour, he says.\n\nCompeting head-to-head with the big, established players in the industry does require that level of rapid scale-up to make a dent in the incumbents’ market share, Kokonis says.\n\nTogether, WestJet and Air Canada account for roughly 75 per cent of the seat capacity in Canadian skies, not to mention other challengers like Flair Airlines.\n\nThe level of competition in the airline industry, and the impact on airfare and services for Canadians, is currently the  subject of a probe from the Competition Bureau .\n\nAnalysts who spoke to Global News say the Porter’s rapid ascent has  helped to drive down prices across the board . More seats means more competition between airlines, experts say, which can lead to more aggressive pricing on overlapping routes.\n\n“Competition is good. It’s good for our country. It’s great for travellers,” Kokonis says.\n\nBut Canadian airfields are metaphorically littered with rusted-out fuselages from countless carriers that tried to take a run at, if not unseating the big two carriers, making space for a viable third national airliner in Canada.\n\nBetween variable fuel costs, airport fees and other pricey inputs, costs for running an airline can be “sky-high,” Kokonis says.\n\n“The reality is, for the airline industry, it’s a tough business to make money in the best of times,” he says.\n\nTo that end, Kokonis says the airline industry is watching Porter carefully from an operational and a financial perspective, to see if the carrier’s “elevated economy” model can work sustainably at scale.\n\nWhile he thinks Porter is heading in the “right direction,” Kokonis believes the airline will need to keep the capital flowing and not stray far from its core offerings in an attempt to become a go-everywhere, do-everything airline too quickly.\n\n“They need to ensure they’re expanding at a rate they need to compete with the Air Canadas, but at the same time doing it in a very prudent fashion to ensure they’re not just here today, but they’re around tomorrow (and) in five years from now,” he says.\n\nWhile Deluce says Porter is “competitively priced,” the airline is eschewing the ultra-low-cost model that rivals such as Flair and WestJet have leaned towards in an attempt to maximize revenues per seat and per kilometre flown.\n\nPorter’s bid to scale up comes after years of high inflation and rising interest rates have left many Canadians feeling strapped for cash and in search of deals on airfare —  if they’re travelling at all .\n\n“The marketplace will decide whether having more flight options or having better fares is what sways them to go with one airline versus another,” says Jim Hetzel, managing director at Cirium.\n\nFor Porter’s part, Deluce is confident that the airline can scale up its flight offerings without sacrificing the quality of service.\n\nAfter years of flight disruptions and nightmare stories stemming from the airline industry during the pandemic, he believes Porter’s approach will benefit not only its own customers, but also the entire sector as competitors seek to raise their service levels, too.\n\n“It elevates everyone’s game,” he says.\n\n"},

It’s a necessary and healthy part of our evolution and growth as a nation.”\n\nInvestigators have previously said two separate searches using ground-penetrating radar at the former school site had detected 159 possible unmarked graves.\n\nThe Catholic-run school operated from 1891 to 1981 about 500 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, and the area being searched covers 782 hectares of land.\n\nThe report says the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation memorial register lists 16 children by name as having died while under the school’s care.\n\nIt says the additional 39 deaths or disappearances were verified “through archival documentation.”\n\nThe report says it received more than 61,000 documents and photos as part of its research.\n\nThe school site was bought by the Williams Lake First Nation last year with the help of the provincial government, in part to help ensure the integrity of the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe report says there are also early plans to “reimagine the site as a place of healing.”\n\nIt says the investigation team is working with the BC Coroner’s Service, RCMP, the B.C. government and others “to determine where – and under what circumstances – excavation of potential graves and the exhumation of human remains can occur.”\n\nIt says they are working on a memorandum of understanding about “excavation, exhumation, identification, and repatriation of remains.”\n\n“At this time, no definitive processes are planned regarding excavation. Engagement sessions will be completed before any decisions are made,” it says.\n\n"},

But on the other hand, we are not. I’m not.”\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the attack, which sparked Israel’s military offensive in Gaza that has killed over 41,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to Hamas-run health officials’ figures that don’t differentiate between civilians and militants.\n\nThe violence has since escalated into a wider conflict in the Middle East between other Iran-backed groups including Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nRoughly 100 of the 250 hostages taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attack are still believed to be held inside Gaza, and ceasefire talks to secure their release have been stalled for several weeks.\n\nSopher was camping with her two young daughters and other families outside her kibbutz, Mefalsim, which sits just three kilometres from the Israel-Gaza border, when Hamas began its attack in the early morning hours. Her husband was at home.\n\nShe quickly realized what had first sounded like thunder before a rainstorm was the sound of thousands of rockets exploding over Israel.\n\n“It kept going and going and going,” Sopher said.\n\nHer instinct from years of living in close proximity to the Gaza Strip, which has long seen conflicts between Israel and Hamas, told her to shield her daughters with her body inside their tent as the explosions continued.\n\n“I grabbed my phone and I called my husband, like, ‘Come pick us up.’ And it went straight to voicemail. And I’m wondering, ‘What do I do?'” she said.\n\n“While I’m trying to think and trying to keep (my daughters) calm, I’m like, ‘I can’t hear anyone outside.’ We’re 30 families. There’s a lot of bombing, like a lot of bombs going on. Why are children not crying? What’s going on?'”\n\nAmid the confusion, armed volunteers helped Sopher and her two small girls into a vehicle, speeding them to their home in Mefalsim where her husband was still safe.\n\n Volunteer security forces have been credited  with fighting off Hamas militants as they attacked Mefalsim and preventing any deaths inside the community.\n\nInside their home, Sopher said, there was no electricity. The family hunkered down with only the lights on their smartphones. They tried to distract the girls with play while trying to stay as quiet as possible.\n\n“How do you tell a three-year-old, ‘Shut up, because there might be bad people outside,'” Sopher said.\n\nSeveral hours after the attack had begun, the family received a message that it was finally safe to flee the area, and members of the Israeli Defence Forces helped them to a waiting vehicle.\n\n“You could see they were scared,” Sopher said.\n\nAs they drove, Sopher saw the horrific aftermath of what had transpired over the past several hours.\n\n“It was like the apocalypse,” she said. “I don’t know if you’ve seen , but it was nothing short of that, just in real life. Bodies there, burnt cars over there.\n\n“You can’t believe it. Like, am I in a movie? Is this real?”\n\nShe said the smell is what sticks in her memory the most.\n\n“You put the pieces together later of, ‘My God, that’s what I was smelling: it wasn’t the bonfire that was lit the night before. It was houses burning, people burning,” she said.\n\nThe military took Sopher and her family to the central Israeli city of Netanya, where they stayed for a week with about 1,000 of their neighbours before travelling to Cyprus, where they still live today.\n\nSopher said despite no deaths in Mefalsim itself, her family and others in her community lost friends and loved ones in the attack.\n\nShe and her husband are both in therapy, and Sopher said her daughters recognize what they went through that day and are starting to talk openly about it.\n\n“No three-year-old, no six-year-old should know, what does kidnap mean,” she said.\n\nAs she continues to process her trauma, Sopher said she has criticisms about Israel’s response. She noted that the IDF members who helped them flee their home took hours to arrive after Hamas launched their attack.\n\n“That’s one of the things that makes me so angry,” she said.\n\n“We have the strongest army, the best army, all the things that we’ve been told over the years. Where were they?”\n\nShe also questions why Israel’s domestic intelligence agencies were unable to stop the attack before it began. To this day, she and the rest of the Israeli population have been told little about what the government knew about Hamas’ plans.\n\n“I’m still waiting to know who knew what and why they didn’t do anything,” she said.\n\n“It’s very sad that we’re small little pieces for the big people that are ruling our lives.”\n\nBut Sopher saves her harshest words for the Hamas militants who caused the trauma she still confronts today.\n\n“They’re bad guys,” she said when asked how she would describe the terrorists to her daughters. “Bad guys that for no other reason than being bad wanted to do bad things to us, and we succeeded because we’re alive and happy and healthy and we need to remain that way.\n\n“Now come make your bed, because you’re not exempt from that.”\n\n"},

But several conservative figures,  including Canada’s Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre,  have said such strikes would be an appropriate response and could further weaken the Iranian regime.\n\nIn an interview with Mercedes Stephenson that aired Sunday on Bolton, a longtime hawk on Iran who served in the Trump administration, said Israel should do all it can to ensure Iran’s next attack doesn’t involve a nuclear warhead.\n\n“If you’re Israel, and you’ve seen in both the April attack from Iran and the Oct. 1 attack hundreds of ballistic missiles launched at you, you could have no confidence that the next time you see a ballistic missile coming from Iran, that under its nose cone it might not have a nuclear weapon,” he said.\n\n“So how long are you willing to take that chance?”\n\nIran’s attack on Oct. 1 came after Israel stepped up its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including killing the militant group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and other senior commanders. Hezbollah receives backing from Iran, which also supports Hamas in Gaza and other proxies in the Middle East that oppose Israel.\n\nBolton,  echoing other analysts of the region , said Iran is “scared to death” of the Israeli government after its military’s actions against Hamas and Hezbollah and knows Israel would have the backing of the U.S. in a direct war with Tehran.\n\nThat, along with the regime’s domestic struggles, puts Iran in a vulnerable position that Bolton says Israel should take advantage of.\n\n“I think that’s the point where Israel can have the maximum impact, precisely by going after the nuclear weapons program,” he said.\n\n“There’s no guarantee they’ll have another opportunity as good.”\n\nPoilievre last week told reporters in Ottawa that an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities  “would be a gift by the Jewish state to humanity.” \n\nDefence Minister Bill Blair told the House of Commons defence committee Thursday that it was “reckless and irresponsible to call for attacks on nuclear facilities, which are very specifically prohibited under international humanitarian law.”\n\nDonald Trump, who is running for president again, told a campaign event after Iran’s Oct. 1 attack that Israel should “hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.”\n\nAlthough Iran officially has a fatwa in place against the development and use of nuclear weapons,  its intelligence minister has warned  that stance could change if it was “cornered,” and there are fears within the international community that Iran could still use its nuclear program to produce such a weapon relatively quickly.\n\nBolton was Trump’s national security advisor when Trump pulled the U.S. out of an international agreement with Iran that limited its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief, effectively killing the pact. International assessments had said Iran was abiding by the deal before it collapsed, but  has since begun enriching uranium once again. \n\nBolton, who long criticized the Iran deal, told Stephenson the pact “gave a false sense of security” and that he believes Iran is now “very close” to developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n“There’s much about Iran’s program that we simply don’t know,” he said.\n\nBolton said Iran’s Oct. 1 attack on Israel, which involved between 180 to 200 ballistic missiles, was “the largest ballistic missile attack in world history,” and that Israel’s primary concern in the short term will be to bolster its air defence system to prevent similarly large barrages in the future.\n\nThere have been few clues as to what Israel might do next in retaliation, which Bolton said suggests the Israeli government is not keeping the U.S. in the loop.\n\n“They’re going to make up their own mind on it,” he said.\n\nEven if Israel forgoes an attack on nuclear sites and strikes Iran’s military or oil production facilities instead, the response could have impacts on the presidential election in November, he added.\n\n“(U.S. President Joe Biden) would simply like to postpone any Israel action until after Nov. 5,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think that’s going to happen, because Israel’s got a pressing need right now.”\n\n"},
{"title": "Is the music industry finally having its #MeToo moment? It sure looks like it. But why now?", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy is the music industry seeing a flood of #MeToo allegations and scandals? Probably because this is long overdue.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10805111/music-industry-metoo-moment-diddy-deryck-whibley-jacob-hoggard/", "article": "Another week, another series of sexual assault-related bombshells from the world of music. First, Diddy.\n\nThe firehose of stories about  Sean (Diddy) Combs  and his “ freak off parties ” involve everything from alleged sexual assault and sex trafficking to kidnapping, weapons charges, drug use and arson. The memes involving the more than 1,000 bottles of lube and baby oil (allegedly laced with the party drug GHB) are everywhere, as are those featuring Los Angeles police standing next to a seized barrel filled with 750 dildos.\n\nEvery day brings more reporting on the A-listers some speculate may have been involved, what some have alleged to have done, the payoffs and cover-ups, the conspiracy theories, and the allegations brought forth by more than 100 complainants.\n\nDiddy’s alleged behaviours are said to be decades old. He sits in a Brooklyn detention centre awaiting trial (probably in April or May), isolated from other inmates for his own safety. Meanwhile, there’s Jeffrey Epstein-level worry about who and what Diddy knows.\n\nThen there’s the case of Sum 41’s  Deryck Whibley  who, in his new memoir, , alleges that the band’s former manager and producer, Greig Nori,  pressured him into non-consensual sexual acts  starting when Whibley was just 16. (Nori says these stories are false and has reportedly retained a defamation lawyer.) It’ll be interesting to see how that all plays out.\n\nOn Thursday, investigators looking into Marilyn Manson announced that they’re reviewing a ton of new evidence involving sex abuse, rape and torture. This is in addition to all the other allegations that have been thrown his way over the last several years. The new claims come just as Manson is trying to restart his once-cancelled music career.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s the ongoing saga of  Jacob Hoggard , the one-time lead singer of Hedley. While he was acquitted of one sexual assault charge earlier this month, there are others. Thursday saw him give up on getting the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn a conviction for assaulting a woman in a Toronto hotel room in 2016. He’s currently serving a five-year sentence for that attack.\n\nThe  list of “problematic artists”  who’ve been accused of abuse and assault goes on: Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Jian Ghomeshi, Win Butler of Arcade Fire, producer Dr. Luke, Diplo, Gary Glitter, the horrific pedophiliac crimes of Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins, Chris Brown, Kodak Black, Sean Kingston and British rapper Slowthai.\n\nIt’s a lot to take in and each week brings more stories. The truth is, though, that these kinds of things have been happening since the dawn of rock ‘n’ roll. Chuck Berry went to jail for statutory rape. Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman with their child brides. David Bowie slept with some of the “Baby Groupies” of L.A. Jimmy Page took a 14-year-old on tour with him.\n\nBack then — a less enlightened time, for sure — people looked the other way. Such behaviours were seen as part of the sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle, the very thing that attracted millions to the world of music. And before social media, such crimes and indiscretions were easy (well, easier) to cover up.\n\nSo why the flood of stories now? A couple of reasons.\n\nThe MeToo movement began in 2006 when Tarana Burke, a survivor of sexual assault, began using the phrase on MySpace as a way to encourage victims to speak up. The hashtag #MeToo first appeared on social media in 2017, drawing more attention to the problem. The result has been a groundswell of empathy, empowerment and solidarity by and for sexual assault victims. Knowing that there’s this kind of belief and support out there makes it more likely for victims to come forward. And they have, some publicly, some anonymously.\n\nAnother reason for people choosing to come forward now has to do with organizations such as  RAINN  (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) stepping up to help with education, support and a friendly ear. If you’re believed and supported, you’re more willing to confide in someone.\n\nThen there are several laws that have come into effect over the last couple of years. In New York state, there’s the Adult Survivor Act, which opened a one-time window for older sexual assault victims. It was under this law that E. Jean Carroll was able to successfully sue  Donald Trump  for sexual assault. That one law opened the doors for at least 2,500 people to seek justice, including cases that were opened against Diddy and Russell Brand. California has something similar, but it limits the window to file a charge to three years and only applies to alleged crimes that happened after Jan. 1, 2009.\n\nThere’s the ubiquity of smartphones. Privacy and secrecy can disappear in an instant. Distribution of incriminating evidence can be done in seconds. Some people were late to that realization and are now being exposed by video, photos and audio that they didn’t know existed.\n\nTo be sure, the music industry is long overdue for a thorough #MeToo reckoning. Society’s tolerance for bad and illegal behaviour has changed drastically. The more stories that are exposed, the more people will come forward.\n\nWe’re in for some interesting times.\n\n—\n\n"},

Bevan will serve during the next federal election.\n\nThe post became empty last month when longtime Trudeau advisor Jeremy Broadhurst resigned, delivering a blow to the party.\n\nLast year, Bevan was appointed chief of staff to Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and senior advisor to the prime minister. He was involved in developing and rolling out the most recent federal budget, the Liberal Party said in a press release.\n\nBevan came to the role from provincial politics, having previously served as chief of staff and principal secretary to former Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne.\n\nHe also has experience working on electoral campaigns, having volunteered for the late former Liberal MP John Godfrey in 1993 and as director of communications for Stephane Dion’s bid for Liberal leader in 2006. He also served as Dion’s chief of staff and principal secretary in opposition from 2007 to 2008.\n\nTrudeau also appointed Marjorie Michel to the post of deputy campaign director. Michel’s background is in Quebec politics, where she held key positions in the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2021 campaigns.\n\n“Andrew Bevan has been a leader in moving forward progressive priorities for more than 30 year,” Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nBevan said his work would focus on connecting Canadians with the Liberal Party and highlighting the government’s work.\n\n“Building on the Liberal Party’s work to connect with more Canadians than ever before, we will build a winning campaign that re-elects Justin Trudeau and even more Liberal MPs, so we can keep Canada moving forward,” he said in a statement.\n\nBevan and Michel’s appointments come at a rocky time for the Liberal Party. Global News learned Saturday that some members of the Liberal caucus were  mounting efforts to force Trudeau to resign . Trudeau has maintained his hold on the Liberal party even as his government’s slide in the polls became a free fall and the Liberals lost two strongholds in Toronto and Montreal byelections.\n\nThe noise grew loudest in late June after the loss of the to the Conservatives, but an attempt to push him out then did not garner  support from more than one or two MPs.\n\nQuestions surrounding Trudeau’s leadership quietened somewhat over the summer, but came roaring back in September after the NDP pulled out of the  supply and confidence deal , national campaign director  Jeremy Broadhurst  quit and the party lost a second critical byelection in  Montreal’s LaSalle—Émard—Verdun  riding to the Bloc Québécois.\n\nIn a statement on his decision to resign, Broadhurst cited the toll two decades and five national campaigns have taken on himself and his family.\n\nHe said the upcoming federal election could be the most critical federal campaign of his life, and the party deserves a campaign director who can bring more energy and devotion to the job.\n\nBroadhurst has been a Liberal staffer in some form for the better part of 25 years, serving multiple times as chief of staff or adviser to several leaders and cabinet ministers.\n\nBroadhurst was national director of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2013 to 2015 and helped retool the Liberal data machine into an operation that helped them win the 2015 election.\n\nHe worked in the Prime Minister’s Office after the 2015 win and, in 2019, was elevated to campaign director.\n\n–with files from Canadian Press\n\n"},

It has eyes that face forward in a way that gave it binocular vision. And now we know they were feathered.”\n\nIn other parts of the world, teeth of a similar dinosaur have been found with serrations as big as those of a T. Rex’s tooth.\n\n“We still haven’t got a complete specimen (of the Troodon formosus) anywhere in the Western North America. It’s crazy,” he said.\n\n“I would love to see them just to learn from it and see what we got right and what we got wrong.”\n\nThe Troodon can be seen in a death pose in the logo of a museum named after Currie in Wembley in northern Alberta.\n\nThe  Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum  is marking its 10-year anniversary next year by exhibiting its recent and largest discovery in northern Alberta so far — the skull of a pachyrhinosaurous.\n\nThe skull alone is the size of a baby elephant.\n\nThe Wembley centre is among several museums Currie has helped build in Canada and around the world, including China and Japan, as dinosaur research boomed over the course of his career.\n\nIt began when he was a 12-year-old growing up in Ontario, reading the Roy Chapman Andrews book  and dashing through the Royal Ontario Museum, looking at all the dinosaur displays, confident he would one day hunt some of his own.\n\nMost of the fossils were from Alberta, so he moved there to work.\n\nThe province is home to the Dinosaur Provincial Park, east of Calgary, where he says 50 species of dinosaurs and 150 species of turtles, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, flying reptiles, mammals and fish lived together.\n\n“That makes it one of the best sandboxes or playgrounds for somebody like me,” he said with a laugh.\n\nOn his first day out in the field, around 1976, he uncovered his first fossil: a spine.\n\n“I was holding in my hands dinosaur bones — this evidence of ancient life.”\n\nHe worked at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, but his expertise has taken him to dinosaur bonebeds all over the world, including regularly to Mongolia and China, along with the University of Alberta in Edmonton, where he teaches.\n\nWhile his subjects were long gone millions of years ago, the science of digging them up has ebbed and flowed for about a century.\n\nIn the 1920s, some of the world’s first paleontologists, including Andrews, had already completed expeditions to China’s Gobi Desert, despite the warlords that ruled the area, and unearthed some of the largest dinosaur fossils seen at the time.\n\nBut until the 1970s, Currie said, the Great Depression and world wars halted further discoveries. It was further hampered by the erroneous belief there were few dinosaurs left to be found.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the ’80s, paleontology grew a bit, aided by advances in technology, but remained in the shadows of popular science.\n\nIn 1993, Hollywood changed that.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg released . Based on the book by Michael Crichton, it told a story of paleontologists pursuing — and being pursued by — dinosaurs brought back to life.\n\nWhile developing his lead character, Alan Grant, Crichton was inspired by the few paleontologists working at the time, including Currie.\n\nCrichton has acknowledged it was Currie’s research method that piqued his interest.\n\nCurrie said the book and movies have shown the world paleontology is “multidisciplinary” and that bones tell stories of not only what lived but how it lived.\n\nPaleontologists, in turn, were viewed less as diggers and more like detectives.\n\n“You’re, first of all, digging (evidence) up. Then you’re trying to figure out what is it or who is the victim, why did they die, why are they being found in this particular way, and what can we learn from this,” he said.\n\n“Every time you answer one question, you end up with two more questions.”\n\nHe said the hours he has spent digging and brushing dirt off fossils in Alberta and all around the world have humbled and matured him.\n\n“When you’re looking at dinosaurs, you look for evidence for why they became extinct,” he said.\n\n“If dinosaurs hadn’t become extinct, what would we look like now? Even though I’m not religious, I think about these things on a bigger scale.\n\n“It’s not just an asteroid hitting the world 65 million years ago. There is something else going on.\n\n“Our story is incomplete.”\n\n"},

Conservatives from forming government, but the Greens say people should support the candidate of their choice.\n\nGreen and NDP voters must stick together this election to defeat the B.C. Conservatives, who are running a campaign of division, denial and plans to dismantle climate initiatives and cut health care and housing affordability plans, Eby said Sunday.\n\nThe NDP leader, at a campaign event in Squamish, asked Green voters to consider their thoughts the day after the Oct. 19 election if Rustad’s B.C. Conservatives were going to form government.\n\n“I want you to just take a moment and think about how it would feel if on Sunday morning, the morning after the election, you wake up and the premier of B.C. is John Rustad and he begins his work to cut the services we all depend on?” said Eby.\n\n“It’s incredibly tight and I’m asking people to think very carefully about how they would feel if they woke up on Sunday morning to premier John Rustad.”\n\nGreen Leader Sonia Furstenau said voters should consider what they want to hear from the parties during the campaign and evaluate their platforms in making their ballot choice.\n\n“Oh, for goodness sake,” she said in an interview Sunday. “I think we should hopefully wake up on the day after the election and have a legislature that is representative of what people in this province want.\n\n“Ideally, that’s not a majority government.”\n\nFurstenau, who has said she doesn’t expect her party to garner enough votes to form government, expressed throughout the campaign that electing Greens would ensure B.C. politics is not dominated in the legislature by the NDP or Conservatives.\n\nAt last week’s televised leader’s debate, Furstenau said both Eby and Rustad will need to be held in check by Green voices in the legislature.\n\nShe said the two leaders are aligned on continuing to subsidize the fossil fuel industry, and both are proposing a program on involuntary care to fight the province’s drug overdose crisis instead of increasing voluntary treatment.\n\n“We’ve put out a platform, a vision,” Furstenau said. “We’ve campaigned in a positive way. We’ve demonstrated that we’ve got solutions for all the things that we’re facing in B.C. If people think that these are good solutions and if they’re inspired, then they should vote for what they want.”\n\nFurstenau, whose Greens won three seats in the 2017 election and helped the NDP form a minority government, has also often said her party was blindsided by the NDP when former premier John Horgan called a snap election in 2020.\n\nFurstenau, who is recovering from a cold and has limited her campaign events over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, was one of two Greens elected to the legislature in 2020.\n\n“The stakes are higher in this election than they’ve ever been before,” Eby said.\n\n“This time let’s stick together. Your vote matters in this election in a way that hasn’t been the case before. We can ensure we’re delivering a high quality health care system and we can make sure we’re continuing to take climate action.”\n\nRustad said at a campaign event Saturday, if elected, he would make cuts to the province’s Clean BC program that aims to reduce harmful climate emissions by 40 per cent by 2030.\n\nFormer B.C. Green leader Andrew Weaver, a climate scientist whose research earned a Nobel prize, said he’s backing Rustad’s Conservatives even though he doesn’t agree with the leader’s skeptical views on climate change.\n\nKevin Falcon, leader of the Official Opposition BC United, suspended his party’s election campaign in late August and asked his incumbents, candidates and supporters to back Rustad’s B.C. Conservatives in an effort to prevent a vote-split on the centre right that would favour the NDP.\n\nBut B.C. Indigenous leaders called for voters to support the NDP “to ensure that Indigenous rights are not rolled back and that we can work together to address the climate emergency.”\n\n“We all need to realize what is at stake and what the consequences will be if your vote leads to John Rustad and the Conservatives getting elected,” said a statement Sunday from Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs vice-president Don Tom and Chief Marilyn Slett of the Heiltsuk Nation.\n\n“We urge you to vote for David Eby and the B.C. NDP in this election,” said the chiefs. “Voting for anyone else risks a win for John Rustad and the B.C. Conservatives.”\n\nRustad has previously said if his party wins the Oct. 19 election, B.C. would partner with First Nations and “unleash the potential” for prosperity through mining, forestry and other resource projects.\n\nHe said earlier the B.C. Conservatives would repeal legislation adopting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, but the party has since said in a release it would honour the declaration “as it was intended,” with laws advancing economic reconciliation and Indigenous autonomy.\n\nElections BC is reporting record voter turnouts for the first three days of advanced voting, with 171,381 people casting ballots on Thursday, 155,464 on Friday and 150,250 Saturday.\n\nAdvance polling was open Sunday, but will close Monday for the Thanksgiving holiday and reopen Tuesday and Wednesday’s ahead of Saturday’s election day.\n\n"},

He will be honoured at a private ceremony of life early next year, MacDonald said.\n\nShe said her husband, who she married in 2009, was “full of life, full of mischief, wanted everything to be an adventure, and it was.”\n\nVigars was the former director of public relations and fundraising for the Canadian Cancer Society.\n\nHe met Fox in 1980 and served as his public relations officer and confidant as the 21-year-old set out with the goal of running across Canada to raise money for cancer research.\n\nVigars was by Fox’s side until the tragic end of his journey in Thunder Bay, when Fox learned the cancer that had taken his right leg had spread to his lungs. Fox died on June 28, 1981, at Royal Columbia Hospital in New Westminster, B.C.\n\nFox’s legacy also set the framework for the annual Terry Fox Run, that would ignite cancer research in Canada, raising more than $850 million since 1980, says the Terry Fox Foundation website.\n\nMacDonald said Vigars made it his mission to keep Terry Fox’s dream alive, noting he would go to four or five schools every September to tell Fox’s story ahead of the annual run. The only September he missed, she said, was this year as he was in the hospital.\n\n“Terry was his guiding light,” MacDonald said of her husband.\n\n“Terry’s tenacity, his convictions, his determination, was all something that Bill liked to live by.”\n\nShe said her husband shared Fox’s vision.\n\n“They were very in sync on that, and Terry was very clear about what his objectives were, and (Bill) didn’t sway from them.”\n\nVigars published a book last year, with Ian Harvey, titled  Released on Aug. 29, 2023, the book is about the Marathon of Hope from Vigars’ perspective.\n\nMacDonald said Vigars was reluctant to do the book at first “because he never wanted to draw any attention to himself” but felt Canadians deserved to know the story.\n\n“(It) truly was a labour of love and that was a huge accomplishment for him and I think he was very proud of that, as he should be,” she said of the book.\n\nHis publisher, Sutherland House Publishing, posted to social media on Friday it was “very saddened” to hear about Vigar’s death, calling him an “author, publicist and close friend of Terry Fox.”\n\n“Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this very difficult time,” it said in the post.\n\nThe Terry Fox Foundation also made a post to social media in Vigars’ honour, saying their “Terry Fox world is smaller and sadder” after hearing the news of his death.\n\n“He saw Terry at his most powerful, vulnerable, and emotional. Bill succeeded at making Terry a relatable, accessible human being, ‘no different than anyone else… no better and… no less,’ as Terry said,” it said of Vigars in a Facebook post.\n\n“This was the greatest gift he could give his beloved friend: a reminder that Terry was just one of us.”\n\n"},

The previous one in June had been the most successful until Sunday’s demo,  completing its flight without exploding .\n\nThis time, Musk, SpaceX’s CEO and founder, upped the challenge for the rocket that he plans to use to send people back to the moon and on to Mars.\n\nAt the flight director’s command, the first-stage booster flew back to the launch pad where it had blasted off seven minutes earlier. The launch tower’s monstrous metal arms, dubbed chopsticks, caught the descending 232-foot (71-meter) stainless steel booster and gripped it tightly, dangling it well above the ground.\n\n“The tower has caught the rocket!!” Musk announced via X.\n\n“Big step towards making life multiplanetary was made today.”\n\nCompany employees screamed in joy, jumping and pumping their fists into the air. NASA joined in the celebration, with Administrator Bill Nelson sending congratulations.\n\nContinued testing of Starship will prepare the nation for landing astronauts at the moon’s south pole, Nelson noted. NASA’s new Artemis program is the follow-up to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon more than a half-century ago.\n\n“Folks, this is a day for the engineering history books,” SpaceX engineering manager Kate Tice said from SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.\n\n“Even in this day and age, what we just saw is magic,” added company spokesman Dan Huot from near the launch and landing site.\n\n“I am shaking right now.”\n\nIt was up to the flight director to decide, in real time with a manual control, whether to attempt the landing. SpaceX said both the booster and launch tower had to be in good, stable condition.\n\nOtherwise, it was going to end up in the gulf like the previous ones. Everything was judged to be ready for the catch.\n\nThe retro-looking spacecraft launched by the booster continued around the world, soaring more than 130 miles (212 kilometers) high.\n\nAn hour after liftoff, it made a controlled landing in the Indian Ocean, adding to the day’s achievement. Cameras on a nearby buoy showed flames shooting up from the water as the spacecraft impacted precisely at the targeted spot and sank, as planned.\n\n“What a day,” Huot said.\n\n“Let’s get ready for the next one.”\n\nThe June flight came up short at the end after pieces came off. SpaceX upgraded the software and reworked the heat shield, improving the thermal tiles.\n\nSpaceX has been recovering the first-stage boosters of its smaller Falcon 9 rockets for nine years, after delivering satellites and crews to orbit from Florida or California.\n\nBut they land on floating ocean platforms or on concrete slabs several miles from their launch pads — not on them.\n\nRecycling Falcon boosters has sped up the launch rate and saved SpaceX millions. Musk intends to do the same for Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built with 33 methane-fuel engines on the booster alone.\n\nMusk said the captured Starship booster looked to be in good shape, with just a little warping of some of the outer engines from all the heat and aerodynamic forces. That can be fixed easily, he noted.\n\nNASA has ordered two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. SpaceX intends to use Starship to send people and supplies to the moon and, eventually Mars.\n\n"},

Last year, Harvard economic historian Claudia Goldin won the prize for her work highlighting the causes of wage and labor market inequality between men and women.\n\nIn 2019, economists Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer won the award for work on fighting poverty.\n\nThe economics prize has been dominated by U.S. academics since its inception, while U.S.-based researchers also tend to account for a large portion of winners in the scientific fields for which 2024 laureates were announced last week.\n\nThat crop of prizes began with U.S. scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the prize for medicine on Monday and concluded with Japan’s Nihon Hidankyo, an organization of survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki who campaigned for the abolition of nuclear weapons landing the award for peace on Friday.\n\n\n\n"},

{"title": "ANALYSIS: The Liberal revolt is about Trudeau, communications, and the carbon tax", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMany Liberal MPs unhappy with their party's performance say change can only happen with a new leader, better communications and a plan to drop unpopular policies.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10810145/analysis-liberal-revolt-trudeau-communications-carbon-tax/", "article": "The hopes of an anxious Liberal caucus were first raised at the end of the summer of 2022 in the resort town of St. Andrew’s, New Brunswick.\n\nLiberals had gathered that August for the first in-person retreat after the pandemic to confront a series of polls that found them trailing the leaderless Conservatives by a few points.\n\nIn September of that year, the Conservatives would find their leader, Pierre Poilievre. Now, two years later, the anxiety of 2022 has turned to the panic of 2024 with multiple polls showing the  Liberals  20 points behind and facing an absolute rout if an election were held this fall.\n\nMany Liberal MPs who once thought they might survive on their own popularity are now facing the reality that they will lose their jobs because of the unpopularity of the same leader who helped them win back in 2015.\n\nLiberal MPs were told at that 2022 caucus that there was a plan to turn things around. They were told the same thing when they met last month in Nanaimo, B.C., for this year’s summer caucus retreat. Indeed, applause could be heard from the closed-door meeting in the room at the conference centre in downtown Nanaimo when Trudeau’s director of strategic communications, Max Valiquette, presented his marketing plan for the months ahead.\n\nNow many of those MPs complain that nothing was done after the St. Andrews meetings. And nothing has been done since Nanaimo.\n\nThe complainers say there has been no promised communications campaign, no change in policies, and no change in the way the PM and his senior aides interact with caucus.\n\nConservative campaigner Cole Hogan, a principal at gt&co, tracks the amount of money each party spends on Facebook advertising, figures which Facebook itself discloses about all political parties. For the week ending Oct. 5,  the Conservatives spent $114,569 on Facebook ads  compared to $3,086 by the Liberals and $1,240 by the NDP.\n\nHogan has documented week after week of this kind of lopsided ad spending ever since that Nanaimo meeting and before it. The data reinforces the views of complaining Liberals that nothing has been done.\n\nAnd while Liberal MPs were promised some sort of marketing campaign to boost their fortunes, the Conservatives produced slick TV ads that aired on legacy television networks. The Liberal response? Trudeau did  a podcast with one of his own backbenchers  and made  an appearance on a U.S. late-night TV show .\n\nThe contrast has some of Trudeau’s MPs shaking their heads.\n\nAt least one of the common complaints of many MPs who spoke to Global News this weekend was addressed Sunday when the party finally named a national campaign director, a position that had been vacant for more than a month after Jeremy Broadhurst resigned from the job.\n\nThe new campaign director is Andrew Bevan, who will be leaving his post as the chief of staff to Chrystia Freeland, the finance minister and deputy prime minister.\n\nBevan is a Liberal ‘old hand,’ a soft-spoken Brit, quick with a smile and a laugh who has been working in and around federal and Ontario Liberal parties for ages.\n\n“Good at reading people, wise in understanding how to help them trust him. And a very nice guy,” Robin Sears, the former principal secretary to NDP leader Ed Broadbent, wrote at Bevan’s LinkedIn page as an endorsement when Bevan joined Freeland’s office.\n\n“Andrew Bevan knows how to win,” David Herle posted on his social accounts. Herle has run several political and federal campaigns for the Liberals.\n\nThat said, Bevan has also ended up as the top staffer in some famous Liberal lost causes. He ran Stephane Dion’s office when Dion was trying — and failing — to sell his Green Shift to Canadians in the 2008 election. He was Kathleen Wynne’s top advisor at Queen’s Park as the Liberal reign in Ontario came crashing down in 2018. Now he may be facing the steepest hill he’s ever had to climb: getting a long-in-the-tooth Trudeau government re-elected in 2025.\n\nIt will be no surprise to him that many of the incumbent Liberals he will be trying help re-elect think the job would be easier with a new leader.\n\nThose who want a leadership change tend to be ‘blue’ Liberals, the kind who might have supported Paul Martin or John Manley in ancient leadership races. Some believe someone like François-Philippe Champagne, who represents Jean Chrétien’s old Shawinigan riding and serves as Trudeau’s minister for  innovation, science and industry, would immediately improve the Liberals’ fortunes if he were leader.\n\nIt’s not just leaders that need to change, say some of the complainers, it’s time also to abandon some cherished policies including the carbon tax.\n\n“It’s out the door anyway when Poilievre wins,” one MP said.\n\nIndeed, several progressive-minded politicians across the country have already decided that it is impossible to campaign and win on a federal carbon price.\n\nNew Democrat premiers Wab Kinew in Manitoba and David Eby in B.C. have called on the feds to scrap the carbon tax.\n\nSaskatchewan NDP Leader Carla Beck is campaigning in the provincial election underway in her province against a carbon tax. And federal NDP Jagmeet Singh, too, is now wavering on the principle of pricing carbon.\n\nIn New Brunswick Liberal leader Susan Holt has also called on Ottawa to cancel any hikes in the carbon tax.\n\nNow, there are members of Trudeau’s own caucus — largely MPs from English-speaking Canada — who think it’s time to do what Polievre’s Conservatives have been constantly calling for and “Axe the Tax.”\n\nGlobal News spoke this weekend with many members of the Liberal caucus. Those who had something substantial to say about a mushrooming caucus revolt — either pro or con — preferred not to be quoted by name.\n\nIndeed, one of those MPs seeking a leadership change said part of the problem is that there is almost no one seeking a revolt who will say so when the TV cameras are pointed at them.\n\nSomeone, this MP said, needs to either hold a press conference or organize a sustained “storm the microphone” campaign at the next Liberal caucus meeting which, given the ‘break week’ ahead, is not likely to occur until Oct. 23.\n\nIt’s unclear how widespread any caucus leadership revolt is.\n\nThe Toronto Star first reported Friday that a movement was underway to get rebels to commit in writing to seek a new leader. Other news organizations, including Global News, have confirmed the existence of such a document.\n\nBut how many have signed? It might be 20. It might be 30. There are, though, more than 150 Liberal MPs. Those who seek a leadership change say there would need to be at least 50 demanding change to force some action.\n\nNews of this ‘revolt’ broke publicly on Friday, as Trudeau and his closest aides were in the midst of a 13-hour flight from Laos to a refuelling stop in Honolulu on an RCAF aircraft with no internet connectivity.\n\nTrade Minister Mary Ng, who was travelling with Trudeau, told reporters during that refuelling stop that she did not learn of this revolt until she fired up her phone as the flight was landing in Hawaii. (Indeed, all the reporters on the plane learned of it the same way.)\n\nAnd yet, back in Ottawa, Trudeau loyalists had already begun the hunt for the rebels.\n\nGlobal News has learned that while Trudeau was in the air, PMO aides were already phoning around to Liberal MPs trying to find those they suspected of signing the document demanding change. Those PMO aides would almost certainly have started with members of the Atlantic caucus.\n\nLast Wednesday, while Trudeau was out of the country, the chair of the Atlantic caucus, Nova Scotia’s Kody Blois, startled the weekly national caucus meeting by declaring that Atlantic MPs had just come from a “a difficult but frank discussion about the future of the party” and then he simply walked out of the closed-door national caucus meeting.\n\n“It was quite unbelievable,” one non-Atlantic Canadian MP said.\n\nMPs who spoke to Global News said Trudeau is now on the verge of losing the support of the Ontario and Quebec caucuses.\n\nAs MPs from those two provinces knock on doors soliciting support, they say that they get positive reviews about the work the government has done (spurred on by Jagmeet Singh’s NDP) on national pharmacare and national dental care but any support Liberals might earn on those policies evaporates when it comes to the leader.\n\n“He’s not just unpopular,” one Liberal said. “He is strongly disliked.”\n\n\n\n"},

South Korea and the U.S. had no immediate responses.\n\nEarlier Monday, South Korea’s military said that it was observing various activities in North Korea that appeared to be preparations for demolishing the roads, such as installing screens.\n\n“They have installed screens on the roads and are working behind those screens, preparing to blow up the roads,” Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing. He said the demolitions could be carried out as early as Monday.\n\nLee said that the South Korean military believes that North Korea may carry out other provocations like a space rocket launch, which the U.N. views as a disguised test of long-range missile technology.\n\nIt’s not clear how much parts of the roads North Korea would destroy.\n\nDuring the previous era of inter-Korean detente in the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected two road routes and two rail tracks across their heavily fortified border. But their operations later were suspended one by one as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea’s nuclear program and other issues.\n\nLast week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with “confrontational hysteria” by South Korean and U.S. forces. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. They said North Korea has also planted mines and removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways.\n\nNorth Korea has accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the North’s Defense Ministry said that the military had ordered artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to “get fully ready to open fire.” The ministry said that the entire South Korean territory “might turn into piles of ashes” following the North’s powerful attack.\n\nNorth Korea often releases warlike rhetoric when animosities with its rivals increase. Experts say it’s highly unlikely for North Korea to launch full-scale, preemptive attacks as it military is outmatched by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces.\n\nKoo Byoungsam, a spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said Monday that North Korea’s accusation over drone flights was likely aimed at creating tensions to reinforce its internal unity while stoking instability in South Korea. Koo said North Korea cannot win what it wants from South Korea with threats and provocations.\n\nSome observers say anti-Pyongyang activists in South Korea might have sent drones this month, but North Korea argues the South Korean government cannot escape responsibility.\n\nIn 2022, South Korea sent surveillance drones across the border into North Korea after it accused North Korea of flying drones into South Korea for the first time in five years.\n\nTensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with North Korea continuing a run of provocative missile tests and South Korea and the U.S. expanding their military drills. Observers say North Korea could perform major weapons tests ahead of next month’s U.S. presidential election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans.\n\nIn January, Kim Jong Un ordered the revision of North Korea’s constitution to eliminate the goal of a peaceful Korean unification, formally designate South Korea as the country’s “invariable principal enemy” and define the North’s sovereign, territorial sphere.\n\nKim’s order stunned many North Korea watchers because it was seen as breaking away with his predecessors’ long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North’s terms. Experts say Kim likely aims to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct dealings with the U.S. They say Kim also likely hopes to diminish South Korean cultural influence and bolster his rule at home.\n\n"},

The single-day record counted aircraft from 5:02 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Shipping traffic was operating as normal, the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan remained defiant. “Our military will definitely deal with the threat from China appropriately,” Joseph Wu, secretary-general of Taiwan’s security council, said at a forum in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. “Threatening other countries with force violates the basic spirit of the United Nations Charter to resolve disputes through peaceful means.”\n\nTaiwan’s Presidential Office also called on China to “cease military provocations that undermine regional peace and stability and stop threatening Taiwan’s democracy and freedom.”\n\nA map aired on China’s state broadcaster CCTV showed six large blocks encircling Taiwan indicating where the military drills were being held, along with circles drawn around Taiwan’s outlying islands.\n\nTaiwan’s defense ministry said the six areas focused on key strategic locations around and on the island.\n\nChina deployed its Liaoning aircraft carrier for the drills, and CCTV showed a J-15 fighter jet taking off from the deck of the carrier.\n\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command spokesperson Senior Captain Li Xi said Monday evening that the drill was successfully completed.\n\nLi said the navy, army air force and missile corps were all mobilized for the drills, which were an integrated operation. “This is a major warning to those who back Taiwan independence and a signifier of our determination to safeguard our national sovereignty,” Li said in a statement on the service’s public media channel.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing that China did not consider relations with Taiwan a diplomatic issue, in keeping with its refusal to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state.\n\n“I can tell you that Taiwan independence is as incompatible with peace in the Taiwan Strait as fire with water. Provocation by the Taiwan independence forces will surely be met with countermeasures,” Mao said.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said it deployed warships to designated spots in the ocean to carry out surveillance and stand at ready. It also deployed mobile missile and radar groups on land to track the vessels at sea. It said as of Monday morning, they had tracked 25 Chinese warplanes and seven warships and four Chinese government ships, though it did not specify what types of ships they were.\n\nOn the streets of Taipei, residents were undeterred. “I don’t worry, I don’t panic either, it doesn’t have any impact to me,” Chang Chia-rui said.\n\nAnother Taipei resident, Jeff Huang, said: “Taiwan is very stable now, and I am used to China’s military exercises. I have been threatened by this kind of threats since I was a child, and I am used to it.”\n\nThe U.S., Taiwan’s biggest unofficial ally, called China’s response to Lai’s speech unwarranted. “We call on (Beijing’s government) to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.\n\nChina held similar large-scale exercises after Lai was inaugurated in May. Lai continues the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China’s demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China.\n\nChina also held massive military exercises around Taiwan and simulated a blockade in 2022 after a visit to the island by Nancy Pelosi, who was then speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. China routinely states that Taiwan independence is a “dead end” and that annexation by Beijing is a historical inevitability. China’s military has increased its encircling of Taiwan’s skies and waters in the past few years, holding joint drills with its warships and fighter jets on a near-daily basis near the island.\n\nAlso on Monday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office announced it was sanctioning two Taiwanese individuals, Puma Shen and Robert Tsao, for promoting Taiwanese independence. Shen is the co-founder of the Kuma Academy, a nonprofit group that trains civilians on wartime readiness. Tsao donated $32.8 million to fund the academy’s training courses. Shen and Tsao are forbidden to travel to China, including Hong Kong.\n\nTaiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists defeated them in a civil war and took power.\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Twenty years after deadly Halifax cargo jet crash, safety improvements lag", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe deadly crash of an MK Airlines cargo plane heightened concerns about crew fatigue and inadequate training, but 20 years later, key safety improvements have yet to be made.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10810849/mk-airlines-halifax-crash-annivesary/", "article": "The deadly crash of an  MK Airlines  cargo plane in Halifax on Oct. 14, 2004, heightened concerns about crew fatigue and inadequate training, but 20 years later, key safety improvements have yet to be made.\n\nSeven crew members — David Lamb, Michael Thornycroft, Gary Keogh, Steven Hooper, Peter Launder, Mario Zahn and Christopher Strydom — died in the crash. Thornycroft was from South Africa, while Zahn was a dual German-South African citizen and the remaining crew were from Zimbabwe.\n\nTheir names are on a granite memorial at the site — a wooded area just beyond the airport’s boundary fence — where the fuel-laden Boeing 747 crashed during takeoff, breaking into pieces and lighting up the early morning sky.\n\nSeconds earlier, the heavily loaded flight had struggled to get off the runway, and as a result its tail — which had dragged along the concrete in a shower of sparks — struck a berm at the end of the runway, snapping off and preventing any hope of recovery.\n\nRay Wagner’s Halifax law office worked with a Toronto law firm representing six of the victims’ families in a lawsuit against the airline, the Halifax airport, a firm that provided training and a company that loaded the aircraft. Wagner said he recalls the lasting trauma on the families. In Nova Scotia Supreme Court records, there are 35 people listed as family members affected by the disaster, including parents, children, siblings and spouses.\n\n“I lament for the families,” Wagner said in an interview last week. “I lament for the children who lost their fathers, and there were a lot of children,” he added.\n\nBut he is also concerned about whether safety lessons have been learned and fully implemented. “Did it cause them (the defendants in the lawsuit) to really change their behaviours? Do they really change their practices to ensure that it doesn’t happen again?”\n\nMike Kruger, former chief executive of MK Airlines — which went out of business in 2010 — did not respond to emails seeking comment on the anniversary. Before the Nova Scotia court, MK denied shortcomings in its safety practices.\n\nInitially, according to a report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the disaster seemed to be simple human error. In 2005, investigators pointed to an incorrect throttle setting that left the plane — carrying 350 tonnes of cargo — without the thrust needed to get off the ground.\n\nThe crew had recently started using software, known as the Boeing Laptop Tool, which calculated the proper power requirement based on the crew inputting the cargo weight, runway length and weather conditions.\n\nIn its analysis, the investigative team found it was possible a crew member using the software inadvertently applied data on cargo weight from the previous flight, which was 110 tonnes lighter, to the Halifax takeoff. As a result, the power setting in Halifax didn’t account for the true weight.\n\nHowever, according to the TSB report, this error had roots in more than one person’s mistake. “Factors that likely contributed to the incorrect takeoff data being generated and then not being detected before the takeoff attempt were flight crew fatigue … (and) inadequate training on the Boeing Laptop Tool,” the report found.\n\nThe TSB concluded the rules about rest used by Ghana-regulated MK Airlines were “one of the least restrictive among the International Civil Aviation Organization’s member states.” MK Airlines allowed shifts of 24.5 hours for three-pilot crews, with up to 18 hours in the air.\n\nBy comparison, at the time in Canada, such crews could only work 20 hours, with a maximum of 14 hours in the air.\n\n“There is a reasonable limit to the time a flight crew can remain on duty before acute fatigue begins to induce unacceptable human performance deficiencies,” the report said. And the board’s analysis indicated the crew’s rest levels “would have been at their lowest level of performance because of fatigue,” just as they were trying to use the software in Halifax.\n\nMeanwhile, evidence was unearthed explaining why the crew weren’t proficient with the software. According to the TSB, the company asked crew to “self study” the 46-page manual and there was “little direct training provided.”\n\nIn addition, even though the company had three previous accidents, the “regulatory oversight of MK Airlines by the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority was not adequate to detect serious non-conformances to flight and duty times, or ongoing non-adherence to company directions and procedures,” wrote the investigator, who documented how the airline had grown quickly after being founded in Zimbabwe and shifting its corporate location to Ghana.\n\nThe Ghanaian authority didn’t respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nThe sole recommendation from the report called on Transport Canada to work with its international counterparts to create a takeoff monitoring system that would immediately alert aircraft crew if there were something wrong with power levels during takeoff.\n\nOn the TSB website, it says that while Transport Canada agrees “in principle with the recommendation,” no such systems yet exist that are reliable. It adds that the industry is “best placed to take the lead to develop” a system that might have warned the pilots of their impending disaster. The safety board responded that Transport Canada could still push for research in this area, working with other regulators.\n\nStricter safety rules have been brought in for Canadian pilots of large aircraft since the crash.\n\nFor example, as of 2020, airlines were to cap the on-duty period for pilots to between nine and 13 hours depending on the flight’s duration, the number of segments flown that day, and duty start times.\n\nHowever, Transportation Safety Board placed crew fatigue on its watch list in 2018, and it has remained there since. The board’s website says it wants to see Transport Canada require “fatigue management systems,” where operators go beyond focusing on the hours of rest, and also set in place systems that assess causes of fatigue and make changes to avoid exhaustion.\n\nThe Canadian Press asked Transport Canada what it is doing to ensure foreign cargo planes landing in Canada have crew on board who are meeting Canadian standards to prevent fatigue. The department didn’t provide a response by deadline.\n\nToronto-based lawyer Paul Miller, whose firm launched the lawsuit on behalf of the six families, said he was pleased that by 2007 they each received settlements “in the seven digits.” He said in an interview last week that details cannot be revealed due to a confidentiality agreement.\n\nHowever, Miller said the legal action was important both for financial and emotional reasons to the families.\n\n“It was really important to give them some explanation of what had happened to their loved ones, and also to get them financial help as the main income earner of each family had been lost in that horrific crash,” he said.\n\n"},

But others were simply rivals of the government of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi , the sources said.\n\nThe Canadian government  announced  Monday it was expelling six Indian diplomats and consular officials “in relation to a targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the government of India.”\n\nThe government acted “to disrupt the chain of operations that go from Indian diplomats here in Canada to criminal organizations, to direct violent impacts on Canadians right across this country,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\nWhile Trudeau provided few details, sources told Global News the Indian diplomats used coercion, and sometimes cash payments, to convince community members to collect information in Canada.\n\nA typical scenario involved the embassy or consulates withholding visas to South Asian community members in Canada who needed to travel to India.\n\nVictims were then told they could have a visa, but they would have to earn it by conducting various tasks. In other cases, payments were used to recruit the informants.\n\nThe tasks assigned to them included attending Sikh temples, and conducting surveillance to determine when individuals left their homes for work each morning.\n\nThe photos and intelligence they amassed were fed back to their handlers at the Indian missions in Canada, and to intelligence officials in India.\n\nOrganized crime groups, notably India’s  Lawrence Bishnoi gang , were then contracted to carry out the violence.\n\nThe incidents police have tied to the Indian government scheme include everything from the 2023 killing of  Hardeep Singh Nijjar  in Surrey, B.C., to a recent  shooting on Vancouver Island  that saw 14 bullets fired at the home of a Punjabi singer.\n\nIndian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma allegedly oversaw the operation. Another Ottawa-based diplomat, as well as two consular officials in Toronto and another two in Vancouver, were allegedly involved.\n\nOver the weekend, the RCMP notified India the six diplomats were persons of interest in its investigations, and asked New Delhi to waive their diplomatic immunity so they could be questioned.\n\nIndia responded by releasing a  statement  Monday accusing Trudeau of playing politics. It also expelled  six Canadian  diplomats, including the acting high commissioner, Stewart Ross Wheeler.\n\nAt a news conference in Ottawa, RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme told reporters investigators had linked Indian government agents to “serious criminal activity in Canada” that posed a “significant threat to public safety.”\n\n“Investigations have revealed that Indian diplomats and consular officials based in Canada leveraged their official positions to engage in clandestine activities, such as collecting information for the government of India, either directly or through their proxies; and other individuals who acted voluntarily or through coercion,” Duheme said.\n\n“Evidence also shows that a wide variety of entities in Canada and abroad have been used by agents of the government of India to collect information. Some of these individuals and businesses were coerced and threatened into working for the government of India,” he said.\n\n“The information collected for the Government of India is then used to target members of the South Asian community.”\n\nIt is not unusual for a country to assign intelligence agents to an embassy or consulate under diplomatic cover. But it would be extraordinary for them to take part in crimes in their host country.\n\nIt is also illegal, but before the alleged agents could be charged, Ottawa would have to ensure they were not protected by the immunity granted to foreign diplomats and consular officers.\n\nIn this case, Canada appears to have decided not to prosecute and instead treat it as a diplomatic incident, notifying the government of India early Monday it was expelling the six diplomatic and consular officials.\n\n“We are not seeking diplomatic confrontation with India,” Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said at a news conference. “But we will not sit quietly as agents of any country are linked to efforts to threaten, harass or even to kill Canadians.”\n\nThe allegations point to an Indian government strategy to target prominent members of the international Khalistan movement, but also those who were only marginally supportive, as well as others with whom the Modi government had a beef.\n\nIndia has repeatedly denied the allegations and on Monday called the suggestion that its high commissioner and other diplomats were involved “preposterous.”\n\nBut the RCMP commissioner said a multidisciplinary team was created in February 2024 to coordinate the many investigations into crimes stemming from the Indian plot.\n\n“The team has learned a significant amount of information about the breadth and depth of criminal activity orchestrated by agents of the government of India, and consequential threats to the safety and security of Canadians and individuals living in Canada,” he said.\n\n“Despite law enforcement action, the harm has continued, posing a serious threat to our public safety. We reached a point where we felt it was imperative to confront the government of India and inform the public about some very serious findings that have been uncovered through our investigations.”\n\n‘The RCMP is hoping to address these threats through our relationship with the government of India and the National Investigation Agency with the end goal of strengthening the safety and security of the Canadian public and South Asian community.”\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada said it had suspected from the outset that the trail of Nijjar’s murder led “directly to India’s consulates and the Indian High Commission in Ottawa.”\n\nThe president of Surrey’s Guru Nanak Sikh Temple and a leading Khalistan activist, Nijjar was gunned down on June 18, 2023. Indian had long called him terrorist. Four alleged gang members were arrested in Alberta and Ontario in May.\n\n“The government of India’s ongoing foreign interference activities in Canada and its history of targeting Sikhs in this country is only now becoming known to the general public but has been the lived experience of Sikhs for the past four decades,” the WSO said.\n\n“Sikhs will not be daunted or intimidated by the criminal activities of the Government of India. Sikhs will continue to fearlessly advocate for Khalistan and against Indian human rights abuses, as they have the right to do.”\n\n Stewart.Bell@globalnews.ca \n\n"},

We don’t know who they’re serving, but like I’ve said before, we don’t think it’s Canadian taxpayers … and they’re definitely not speaking on behalf of their workforce.”\n\nThe return-to-office mandate was announced in May, with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat — effectively a central nerve agency for federal departments — updating its policy to require employees to work from the office three days a week instead of the current two starting Sept. 9.\n\nThe Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents about 260,000 workers, called the decision “purely political” and launched a series of legal complaints, while encouraging members to file individual grievances.\n\nBeing the employer, however, the federal government has the legal right to determine how work is done, legal experts note.\n\nBut Prier criticized the return to work, saying offices are in “way worse condition” than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“There’s limited office space, there’s poorly-designed hotel booking systems, you can’t get the same desk every day, you’re not sitting with your team,” he said. “Most of us are just going to the office to sit in virtual meetings.”\n\nHe said he’s hopeful OGGO will look into whether the workplace is conducive to work and what costs are being seen by having employees back in office.\n\nAs PSAC warned of a “summer of discontent” over the policy earlier this year, Treasury Board President Anita Anand wouldn’t budge, saying the right to hybrid work is not enshrined for federal public workers.\n\nIn rolling out its plan, the Treasury Board and its secretariat said  in a message to deputy ministers  the move was to “reflect the benefits that consistent in-person interactions offer.”\n\n“These include more effective collaboration and onboarding of new talent, as well as building a strong culture of performance that is consistent with values and ethics of the public service,” the message read.\n\nPrier criticized that notion on Monday,  pointing to data from Statistics Canada and collected by PSAC  which showed a 4.5-per cent growth in productivity between 2019 and 2023 in federal government services.\n\n“The government, the employer’s own data on that says that we were more productive in the period of remote work,” he said.\n\nAnand said in a statement to Global News on Tuesday that the decision for the three-day return-to-work policy was taken by the Treasury Board Secretariat, working with the Privy Council and deputy ministers, who were in support of the change.\n\n“This was not a political decision,” Anand wrote.\n\nShe said she was also aware of CAPE’s request and would wait for a response from the committee.\n\nAs CAPE pursues a parliamentary review, PSAC took its  fight to the Federal Court , which agreed to hear the concerns.\n\nThe union said the hearing will be a “major step” for workers looking for transparency around the decision to return workers to the office.\n\nGlobal News reached out to OGGO to inquire if the committee would be hearing the request by CAPE, though it did not hear back by deadline.\n\nPrier added the unions are “dividing up the work,” adding the organizations are working together to speak up against the move.\n\n"},

And where there is water, there could be life, making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for it.\n\nEuropa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors. Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions.\n\n“Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be habitable, but they might be habitable today,” NASA’s Gina DiBraccio said on the eve of launch.\n\nSpaceX started Clipper on its 1.8-billion-mile (three-billion-kilometre) journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors.\n\nNASA didn’t learn until spring that Clipper’s transistors might be more vulnerable to Jupiter’s intense radiation field than anticipated. Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission could proceed as planned.\n\nHurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several days.\n\nAbout the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled, Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for gravity assists. The nearly 13,000-pound (5,700-kilogram) probe should reach the solar system’s biggest planet in 2030.\n\nClipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to our own moon in size.\n\nThe spacecraft will skim as low as 16 miles (25 kilometres) above Europa — much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will attempt to penetrate the moon’s ice sheet, believed to be 10 miles to 15 miles or more (15 kilometres to 24 kilometres) thick. The ocean below could be 80 miles (120 kilometres) or more deep.\n\nThe spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection against radiation.

On Monday it dismissed Canada’s move on the inquiry and accused Trudeau of pursuing a “political agenda.”\n\n“We have no faith in the current Canadian Government’s commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt later said it had asked the six Canadian diplomats to leave by Saturday.\n\nIt also said it had summoned Canadian Charge d’Affaires Stewart Wheeler to protest.\n\nWheeler on Monday reiterated Trudeau’s accusation, saying in a statement: “Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\n\n“Now, it is time for India to live up to what it said it would do and look into those allegations.”\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Monday that it has  significant amount of information on criminal activity  orchestrated by agents of the Indian government.\n\nThe investigations have revealed that Indian diplomats and consular officials based in Canada are leveraging their official position to engage in “clandestine activities,” the RCMP said.\n\nThe Indian government has been collecting information through its officials in the country and this information is then used by the Indian government to target members of the south Asian community, according to the RCMP.\n\nTrudeau said on Monday that the actions were “unacceptable,” and said while the RCMP and national security officials have made attempts to work with the Indian government and law enforcement, they’ve been “repeatedly refused.”\n\n“This is why, this weekend, Canadian officials took an extraordinary step,” Trudeau said. “They met with Indian officials to share RCMP evidence which concluded six agents of the Government of India are persons of interest in criminal activities and despite repeated requests to the government of India, it has decided not to cooperate.”\n\nThe prime minister went on to say the evidence could not be ignored and it was necessary to disrupt criminal activities posing a threat to safety.\n\n“We will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil, a deeply unacceptable violation of Canada’s sovereignty and of international law,” he said.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said as part of the investigation, it was requested that India waive diplomatic immunity for six individuals based on Canada so as to be able to question them as part of the RCMP investigation.\n\n“Regrettably, as India did not agree and given the ongoing public safety concerns for Canadians, Canada served notices of expulsions to six diplomats and consular officials early this morning,” she said. “We’re not seeking diplomatic confrontation with India, but we will not sit quietly as agents of any country are linked to efforts to threaten, harass or even kill Canadians.”\n\nWhen asked if the federal government was considering sanctions, Joly did not confirm but she did say that expelling diplomats was the “highest and toughest measure” that a country can take under the Vienna Convention, adding they’d continue to push India to “make sure that they cooperate.”\n\nIndia has repeatedly said Canada has not shared any evidence to back its claim.\n\n“This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains,” India’s foreign ministry said earlier on Monday.\n\nBritish Columbia Premier David Eby said he believed the information provided by the RCMP was “unprecedented” and “profoundly disturbing.”\n\nAsked if he was worried about the well-being of the Sikh community in B.C., Eby said he was “profoundly concerned.”\n\n“I know there are many people, on hearing this news who are concerned about their own safety, there are others who are wondering ‘how is this possible,’ that the government of India could potentially be involved in this kind of violent activity in Canada,” he said.\n\n“But I can assure the SIkh community, but I can assure everybody in British Columbia and in Canada is that as far as the RCMP are involved, we will make sure they have all of the resources necessary to protect different communities in our province from foreign interference and also to make sure that they hold those involved in Canada accountable for any action threatening British Columbian, an Ontarian, an Albertan or Canadian.”\n\nEby went on to say he was told by Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc there was “credible evidence” about potential crimes committed.\n\n“There is credible evidence that the government of India through agents in Canada has been involved in homicides, plural, extortions, plural, acts of violence against Canadians, acts of intimidation against Canadians, with an aim of advancing the interests of the government of India,” Eby said. “This is obviously a very serious allegation and I am certain he would not be raising these issues, the RCMP would not be holding a press conference, if this wasn’t serious and credible information.”\n\nCanada withdrew more than 40 diplomats from India in October 2023 after New Delhi asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence.\n\nIn June, a committee of Canadian parliamentarians named India and China as the main foreign threats to its democratic institutions, based on input from intelligence agencies.\n\nThe U.S. has also alleged that Indian agents were involved in an attempted assassination plot of another Sikh separatist leader in New York in 2023, and said it had indicted an Indian national working at the behest of an unnamed Indian government official.\n\nIndia expressed concern after the U.S. raised the issue, dissociating itself from the plot, and has launched an investigation.\n\nThe accusations of assassination plots against Sikh separatist leaders in Canada and the U.S. have tested their relationship with India as they look to forge deeper ties with the country to counter China’s rising global influence.\n\n\n\n—\n\n"},

And that’s quite worrying; and nobody knows how to prevent that for sure, so we need to do lots of research on that right now.”\n\nHinton’s joint prize was for work using physical to “design artificial neural networks that function as associative memories and find patterns in large data sets,” according to a member of the Nobel committee.\n\nDiscoveries Hinton worked on are now used to advance physics in areas like facial recognition and language translation, according to the committee member.\n\nHinton, who left Google so he could speak more openly about the dangers artificial intelligence poses, said health care was a key area where artificial intelligence can be a huge help.\n\nWhere the technology goes in the next decade, he said, is impossible to predict, even for those leading the growth and development of AI.\n\n“I don’t think you can see clearly ten years in the future, things are moving too fast,” he said. “It’s like fog with fog, you can see very clearly for a certain distance and then the wall comes down and after that, you can’t see anything.”\n\nHe suggested that looking back at the past decade shows just how fast the technology can develop.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI and technology over the past decade has confounded all expectations, Hinton explained, pointing to large language models like ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini as examples.\n\nWhile the technology still has hiccups and issues with inaccuracy, it can generally write complete and compelling sentences, something the industry could not have predicted 10 years ago, he said.\n\n“These large language models and their ability to deal properly with natural language is amazingly much better than we would have predicted 10 years ago,” he said.\n\n“Nobody thought we would have language models that could answer any question you gave and could be a not-very-good expert at everything — that’s amazing. Ten years ago, people would have very confidently predicted we wouldn’t be there yet.”\n\n\n\n"},

Gurdwaras Council spokesperson Moninder Singh told Global News.\n\n“Harder steps by the Canadian government against India is what we want to see. So while these individuals have left, how do we avoid this situation in the future?”\n\nFour men linked to organized crime have been charged in Nijjar’s killing. Monday’s update from the RCMP has shed further light on the case, with the investigation linking senior Indian diplomats in Canada, including High Commissioner Sanjay Verma, to criminal gangs operating in Canada.\n\nSikh leaders in B.C. say they won’t be pressured.\n\n“The Nijjar murder was a line for our community,” Singh said. “If you try to intimidate our community, if you try and silence us, we will do the opposite.”\n\nBC NDP Leader David Eby said the B.C. government has been briefed on the investigation, and the province is doing everything it can to support police and keep the Sikh community safe.\n\n“British Columbia will continue to ensure that our police have all the resources they need to get to the bottom of this and hold those involved accountable,” he said.\n\n“Our province’s strength is the fact that people come here from around the world, and they can be safe, build a good life for themselves and their families. Anything that threatens that is a threat to all of us. We will stick together. We will not let any foreign government divide us.”\n\nBC Conservative Leader John Rustad called the allegations “deeply troubling,” and called for an investigation into foreign interference targeting the Sikh community and other Canadians.\n\n“The Sikh Community in British Columbia, like every other group, deserves to live in safety without fear of intimidation or harassment by foreign governments,” he said in a statement.\n\nSingh said the Sikh community has been long pressing for an inquiry specifically focused on allegations of foreign interference by the Indian government and an end to intelligence sharing with India.\n\nHe also wants to see the government pursue criminal charges, if possible.\n\n“While this is a very welcome step, we really do want to see (the government) pursuing that diplomatic immunity that Mr. Burma has, these diplomats have,” he said. “And is there any possibility of prosecuting them within Canada?”\n\nThe government of India denies any suggestion that it has been involved in crimes in Canada.\n\nThe South Asian country retaliated by expelling six Canadian diplomats on Monday and withdrawing its own envoy from Canada.\n\n"},

Experts say foreign workers aren’t the answer", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Toronto-area Burger King can't fill a manager position, raising questions about the pay it's offering — and whether the temporary foreign workers program is suppressing wages.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10808022/foreign-workers-canada-domestic-wages/", "article": "A job listing at a Toronto-area  Burger King  has prompted observers and experts to wonder whether the  temporary foreign workers  program is being used to avoid paying higher salaries to Canadians.\n\nOn Sept. 25, a Burger King in Mississauga, Ont., posted an opening for a restaurant manager position on the federal government’s online job bank.\n\nThe post drew criticism from some social media users, who noted that underneath the posting, a banner reads, “This employer has applied for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to hire a foreign worker to fill labour or skills shortages on a temporary basis.”\n\nThis means that the employer, unable to hire a domestic worker for the post, has requested permission from the federal government to open the position up to foreign workers.\n\nA spokesperson for Burger King told Global News that the posting “is directly related to one or more open management positions in the Mississauga area that have not been filled for several months after advertising across employment platforms and not receiving any qualified candidates.”\n\nThe job comes with an annual salary offer of $48,000, which works out to be just under $25 an hour, with hours listed as “Day, Evening, Night, Weekend, Early Morning, Morning.”\n\nGlobal News asked Burger King whether they considered raising the advertised salary to attract more people for the role before applying for a LMIA.\n\n“The wage at which the job was posted is a competitive range amongst quick service restaurants in the Mississauga area, which is based on competitive data and the Franchisee’s experience in hiring in this market,” the spokesperson said in response.\n\nThere’s nothing illegal about what Burger King is doing, and no rules are being broken.\n\nIt comes amid growing scrutiny on the Temporary Foreign Worker program and growing concerns about whether access to less expensive labour through the program can hurt the potential for wage growth in communities.\n\nMatthew Green, the labour critic of the federal NDP, told Global News, “This case is yet another example of decades of abuse that highlights how the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) program is being exploited by industries to source cheap labour, suppressing wages for Canadian workers. Employers are using the TFW program not as a short-term solution, but as a way to avoid offering higher wages that would attract and retain local workers.”\n\nGlobal News also reached out to the Conservatives with questions.\n\nIn response, the Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s office sent a quote from a press conference he did in August, saying: “I challenge Canadian business to hire Canadian workers first and I challenge the government to end the chaos in the temporary foreign worker program, bring the numbers down, and allow Canadians to get good solid paying jobs that will give them enough money to buy an affordable home and food in safe neighborhoods.”\n\nEmployment and Social Development Canada did not comment on this specific case due to privacy concerns, but added that it had a strict criteria for assessing LMIA applications.\n\n“Employers seeking to hire temporary foreign workers must always demonstrate that they cannot find Canadians or permanent residents to meet their labour needs. This is a last resort program for employers. There are also national minimum advertising standards for employers who want to hire temporary foreign workers,” a spokesperson for ESDC told Global News.\n\nThe agency said employers must report on their efforts to recruit or interview Canadian citizens and permanent residents. They added that an LMIA application is no guarantee that a positive LMIA will be granted.\n\n“As part of the LMIA approval process, the federal government requires proof that Franchisees have advertised for at least four weeks to show that efforts have been made to fill the position locally. In this case, they have far exceeded that requirement. The role continues to be available and open to all applicants,” Burger King said in its statement to Global News.\n\nThe posting on the job bank indicates that the Burger King salary is slightly higher than the median wage for similar positions across Canada, which is around $22 an hour.\n\nAccording to the Ontario Living Wage Network (OLWN), the living wage for the Greater Toronto Area is $25.05 per hour.\n\nManan Gupta, a regulated Canadian immigration consultant based in Brampton, Ont., said the practice of employers listing jobs and seeking foreign workers isn’t a surprise.\n\nHe added, “It has become a tool to exploit both Canadian and foreign workers. Unfortunately, this abuse is not going away.”\n\nGupta said what he describes as misuse of the system is bigger than just one employer or one sector. He pointed to a nexus between “greedy employers” and “shady immigration practitioners.”\n\nChristopher Worswick, an economist at Carleton University, said economists have been concerned that the temporary foreign workers program gives employers permission to rely on cheap labour.\n\n“In the absence of a temporary foreign worker program, normally the firm would have to decide to reapply or re-advertise at a higher wage, or maybe do something else, like hire a different type of worker, invest in new technology, capital equipment,” he said.\n\n“The existence of a temporary foreign worker program sort of short-circuits that process.”\n\nHe said the reliance on foreign workers can also lead to abuse of those immigrant workers who have little choice but to accept low-paying jobs with little power to negotiate with employers who their visas depend on.\n\n“It’s not like you can walk across the street and work for a similar restaurant in a similar role at a higher wage. The tying of the worker to the job is especially problematic,” he said.\n\nWorswick said the reliance of employers on the program not only slows wage growth but can actually lower wages.\n\n“You’d actually expect lower wages in general for jobs where this was an option. Employers could advertise at a slightly lower wage, knowing that that raises the probability of failure in their search within Canada because they’re advertising a lower wage than they might otherwise,” he said.\n\nWorswick said economists use the term “market-clearing wage rate” for such instances.\n\n“If you’re consistently advertising at a wage at which there’s vacancies, then that suggests that that wage isn’t the market-clearing wage. You’ve set the wage too low in your advertising. You should raise that up until you get someone qualified applying,” he said.\n\nMax Roy, vice president of Restaurants Canada, said the hospitality sector needs foreign workers.\n\n“Temporary foreign workers represent about 3 per cent of our workforce for the industry across Canada. But it’s a very important 3 per cent. Two-thirds of the temporary foreign workers are actually cooks. And without cooks, you just don’t have a restaurant,” he said.\n\nIn August, the federal government announced it was introducing  restrictions to the TWF program .\n\nThe government said it will refuse applications for low-wage temporary foreign workers in regions with an unemployment rate of six per cent or higher. The Greater Toronto Area, of which Mississauga is a part, has an unemployment rate of 7.9 per cent.\n\nA low-wage job is defined as one that pays below the median hourly wage in the province where the job is located.\n\nFor employers, there will be a cap of 10 per cent of employees coming from the low-wage stream of the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program and a reduction of maximum duration of employment from two years to one,  according to the Employment and Social Development Canada .\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said the program has helped the economy recover in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, but with inflation slowing down and employment levels up compared to before, the country no longer needs as many temporary foreign workers.\n\n“We need Canadian businesses to invest in training and technology and not increasing their reliance on low-cost foreign labour,” he said.\n\n“It’s not fair to Canadians struggling to find a good job, and it’s not fair to those temporary foreign workers, some of whom are being mistreated and exploited.”\n\nThe Burger King job posting was posted a day before the changes went into effect.\n\nBenjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at CIBC, said this was one of the reasons productivity in Canada was lagging.\n\n“We simply have too many workers working in low-paying industries. And if companies have an unlimited supply of very cheap labor, they will not invest in capital, they will not improve the productivity. And that’s one of the reasons why productivity in Canada is lagging behind,” Tal said.\n\nWorswick said the TFW program needs to be done away with entirely.\n\nInstead, he said the government should issue open work permits to foreign workers.\n\n“It would be much better if we went back to a world where we admit medium to high-skilled immigrants in large numbers and then let them work where they want. Don’t tell them they’re tied to one employer, which is what we typically do in the temporary foreign worker program.”\n\nMatthew Green of the NDP proposed something similar.\n\n“Workers should arrive with landed status, preventing exploitation and ensuring fair treatment. Temporary workers in Canada should be regularized, granting them the rights they deserve, which would stop employers from using the TFW program to suppress wages,” he said.\n\nRestaurants Canada recommends implementing a “matching and training program.”\n\n“If you’re going to reduce the number of temporary foreign workers, fine. But please help us find those individuals within Canada that don’t have a job and would be willing to work and learn on onsite,” Max Roy of Restaurants Canada said.\n\nTal said that while restaurants may feel the pinch in the short term, this move could improve productivity in the long run.\n\n“You have to innovate. You have to think about different menus. You have to think about different ways of attracting people while employing less people or paying them a bit more.”\n\n"},

The foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters query for comment.\n\nIndia has previously rejected as “preposterous” all Canadian accusations about the murder.\n\nHere are key facts about Bishnoi and his associates.\n\nThe NIA has accused the 31-year-old law graduate, in jail since 2015, of running a trans-national crime syndicate.\n\nBorn in the northern state of Punjab, Bishnoi is short and lean, sporting a beard and mustache when seen in public for court appearances.\n\nIn statements, the NIA has said he runs his syndicate from jails in different states, as well as countries such as Canada, through associates, who have been in contact with “pro-Khalistani” elements in neighboring Nepal and other countries.\n\nHowever, Bishnoi has said he opposes Khalistan, or the demand for an independent Sikh state, and was not “anti-national,” in an interview with a private news channel last year.\n\nThe video of the interview has since been taken down and police are investigating how the video came about.\n\nBishnoi is an inmate of the Sabarmati central jail in the western industrial city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat state. Media have said he has been moved around different prisons out of concern for his safety – and his ability to break jail rules.\n\nCanada did not state specific charges, but the RCMP said there was “specific targeting” of those supporting Khalistan in the country.\n\nIt named the Bishnoi organized crime group as having earlier claimed some of those actions, and accused it of being linked to Indian agents.\n\nBishnoi and his associates face several murder, extortion and terror-related charges.\n\nThe NIA has said they want to unleash a wave of terror through targeted killings of well-known social and religious leaders, movie stars, singers and businessmen.\n\nSome high-profile cases include the 2022 killing of a popular Punjabi rapper named Sidhu Moose Wala, which the NIA laid at the door of Bishnoi’s associates.\n\nPolice, who arrested more than 20 people, have named Bishnoi as a key suspect, media have said.\n\nIn a video released by media channels, Bishnoi threatened to kill actor Salman Khan, an icon of India’s Bollywood film industry, in 2018. Shots were fired near Khan’s house this year. Bishnoi has not commented on the matter, however.\n\nThe police arrested two gunmen for an attack they later said was at the behest of Bishnoi’s group.\n\nOn Saturday, gunmen in the business capital of Mumbai shot dead a lawmaker named Baba Siddique before fleeing.\n\nAn individual claiming to belong to Bishnoi’s group took responsibility for the killing in a posting on Facebook. Police officials have since told media Bishnoi was behind the plot, without citing evidence.\n\nBishnoi’s lawyer, Rajani, who only uses one name, said he faces about 40 cases of murder, extortion and terror-related charges, dating back to 2012, throughout India.\n\nHe has contested the accusations, with trials in many of these cases yet to start, she added.\n\n\n\n"},

Yukon and Nunavut use the federal system but have an agreement to distribute the proceeds themselves.\n\nThe parliamentary budget officer says most Canadians get back more from the rebates than they pay.\n\nHe also says, though, that the economic impact of carbon pricing could lower wages over time, erasing that benefit for some Canadians. The government argues that climate change itself can cause economic harm if it is left unchecked.\n\nOttawa has been battling with banks about how the deposits are labelled since they moved to quarterly payments for the rebates in 2022.\n\nMany Canadians were confused — or didn’t even realize they were getting a rebate — when payments showed up with vague labels like “EFT deposit from Canada,” “EFT Credit Canada” or just “federal payment.”\n\nSome banks previously argued the term “Canada Carbon Rebate” went beyond their 15-character limit on deposit descriptions.\n\n"},

The association said it is now forecasting just a 0.9 per cent annual increase for 2024 to $683,200, down from its previous outlook of a 2.5 per cent annual increase.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, the number of homes that changed hands in September rose 6.9 per cent, but CREA said sales ticked up just 1.9 per cent month-over-month from August after the Bank of Canada’s third straight rate cut.\n\nThere were 185,427 properties listed for sale across Canada at the end of September, up 16.8 per cent from a year earlier but still below historical averages of around 200,000 for this time of the year.\n\nNew listings grew 4.9 per cent month-over-month in September due to broad-based gains across most of the country’s biggest markets.\n\nThe association said a “sharper rebound” is expected by next spring.\n\n“Sales gains are now three for three in the months following interest rate cuts, which is a trend even though the increases weren’t headline-grabbing,” said CREA senior economist Shaun Cathcart in a press release.\n\n“That said, with the pace of rate cuts now expected to be much faster than previously thought, it’s possible some buyers may choose to hold off on a purchase for now. This could further boost the rebound expected in 2025 at the expense of the last few months of this year.”\n\nThe Bank of Canada began its rate-lowering process in June and has cut its key rate by a quarter-percentage point a total of three times so far this year, bringing it to 4.25 per cent.\n\nThe central bank faces its next interest rate decision on Oct. 23. Governor Tiff Macklem has said it is reasonable to expect more cuts are coming given recent progress made on lowering inflation.\n\nCREA said Tuesday it anticipates national home sales will climb 6.6 per cent in 2025 as interest rates continue to decline and spur renewed demand, while average home prices are forecast to rise 4.4 per cent to $713,375 next year.\n\n"},

Despite annual declines for seafood and nuts and seeds, fresh or frozen beef prices were up 9.2 per cent last month, edible fats and oils cost 7.8 per cent more and egg prices rose 5.0 per cent annually.\n\nPrices for airfare were down 4.4 per cent in September and fell 14.3 per cent on a monthly basis, which StatCan noted was typical of seasonal trends heading into the fall.\n\nWhile rent and higher mortgage costs continue to lift inflation, there was some cooling on the shelter front in September as well. Rents rose 8.2 per cent annually last month, down from 8.9 per cent in August, StatCan said.\n\nDespite the recent easing in the annual figures, the agency added that, over the past three years, the cost of living has soared and remained elevated.\n\nTu Nguyen, economist with RSM Canada, says that while the more modest levels of inflation are likely welcome news for consumers, Canadians should not expect a return to pre-pandemic prices.\n\n“Price levels are right now permanently higher than they were from a few years ago, and that’s not going to change. We are not going to see prices straight-up coming down,” she says.\n\nThere are exceptions in certain categories of the consumer price index, like airfare and clothing, which reported annual declines in September.\n\nShannon Terrell, lead writer and spokesperson with NerdWallet Canada, says there are segments where Canadians are “getting a little bit of a break,” but the bulk of price hikes in recent years have been in the “non-negotiables” like shelter and grocery costs.\n\nThe overall consumer price index is up 12.7 per cent over three years, with rent up 21 per cent and grocery prices up 20.7 per cent over that period, according to StatCan.\n\n“Although we’re seeing inflation in a better place now, we have to acknowledge by and large that Canadians have been struggling with these raised costs for essentials for a number of years now,” Terrell tells Global News.\n\n“The cumulative effect of inflation, especially over the last couple of years, really cannot be understated.”\n\nThe Bank of Canada has been lowering its benchmark  interest rate  in recent months as its focus shifts increasingly towards fears that inflation will dip too far below its two per cent target.\n\nThe sharp drop comes ahead of the Bank of Canada’s next interest rate decision on Oct. 23. While another interest rate cut is widely expected by economists, forecasters are weighing whether a steeper, 50-basis-point drop could be in the cards, rather than the typical 25-basis-point step.\n\nSome economists said Tuesday that the sharp drop in inflation last month tilts the scales towards a bigger cut.\n\nBMO chief economist Doug Porter said in a note to clients Tuesday that the latest inflation figures, alongside recent data releases showing consumer and business sentiments are still depressed and the unemployment rate remains elevated, “will be enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to opt for a 50 bp rate cut later this month.”\n\nCanadian swap markets increased the bets for an oversized 50 basis point rate cut next week to 67 per cent after the inflation data was released, according to Reuters, up from roughly 52 per cent previously.\n\nNguyen also believes there’s little reason for the Bank of Canada to hold back from an oversized step as inflation continues to cool.\n\n“This report certainly increases the odds of a 50-basis-point cut, but that is not set in stone,” she says.\n\nWhile StatCan’s September jobs report was relatively strong, she believes the surge in full-time hiring was in part spurred by the central bank’s own rate cuts, as businesses feel increasingly confident to add to their payrolls.\n\nIf the Bank of Canada does not pick up the pace of its cuts, Nguyen believes the so-called “soft landing,” wherein the Canadian economy returns to price stability without tipping into a recession, would be at risk.\n\nNguyen expects annual inflation will float around two per cent in the months ahead. But if the Bank of Canada keeps rates at restrictive levels for too long, that could drive inflation even lower, she argues.\n\nWhile rock-bottom inflation rates, or even deflation, might sound great to consumers, Nguyen says such a scenario could have disastrous impacts on the Canadian economy. If households believe prices are going to keep dropping lower, they’ll hold back their spending, delaying the economic recovery the Bank of Canada is hoping to stimulate.\n\n“If the Bank of Canada does not speed up, it risks putting the economy into a contractioning trajectory,” Nguyen says.\n\n\n\n"},

Smith, acting under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. statement said Samidoun and Barakat “play critical roles in external fundraising for the PFLP.”\n\nPublic Safety Canada (PSC) lists Samidoun as an international network of organizers and activists that “claims to be campaigning for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.”\n\nAccording to PSC, the organization first emerged in 2011 and has at least 20 chapters in 12 countries, including Canada and the United States.\n\nIt also has a chapter in Iran, which has designated as a state supporter of terrorism.\n\nThe department says many of the prisoners Samidoun is advocating for release have ties to terrorism, assassinations and countless attacks against Israel.\n\n“Samidoun’s ideology revolves exclusively around the worldview that Israel and Zionism are the greatest danger to the Middle East and the world,” the listing notes. “Their main goals are the destruction of Israel and establishing a Palestinian state in its place.”\n\nThe leadership of Samidoun is reportedly composed of current and former members of the PFLP, Public Safety Canada says.\n\nBeing a listed terrorist entity carries  severe consequences . It is illegal to contribute to any activity of a listed group, and its property can be seized and forfeited.\n\nThe listing comes just over a week after MPs in the House of Commons condemned the group, whose supporters chanted “death to Canada, death to the United States and death to Israel” and burned the Canadian flag at a rally in Vancouver.\n\nThe masked speaker at that rally who uttered the chant over a microphone also told the crowd “we are Hezbollah and we are Hamas.”\n\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are listed as terrorist entities.\n\nThe Conservatives during question period last Tuesday called on the federal government to list Samidoun as a terrorist organization.\n\n“Samidoun has been fomenting these violent and horrific protests and mob actions, this organization is a front for an already banned terrorist group,” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said last week.\n\nVancouver Police say  they are also conducting an investigation into the pro-Palestinian rally  in which the chant and flag burning took place, where law enforcement say speakers expressed “solidarity with terrorist groups.”\n\nThe police force has previously investigated Samidoun, having arrested its director — and Barakat’s wife — Charlotte Kates last year in a hate-crime investigation. She was released from custody on an undertaking,  but the hearing which she was to appear at was cancelled , and her court-ordered conditions along with it.\n\nB.C. NDP leader David Eby, who is running for premier in Saturday’s provincial election and previously condemned the chants made at the Vancouver rally, said in a statement Tuesday that he agreed with the federal designation.\n\nHe went on to say there has been a “disturbing rise” in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel which killed 1,200 people.\n\n“There is no place in British Columbia for groups inciting and glorifying violence,” Eby said.\n\n\n\n"},

And it’s just been it’s such a debilitating disease,” she said.\n\nMcNamara was only 24 when she found out she could have endometriosis, a condition where tissue grows outside the uterus and causes severe pain. She’s had multiple ER visits, severe bloating and bladder issues.\n\nOther than birth control, she was told there wasn’t much doctors could do.\n\n“In the last year, I was experiencing a really rare symptom. It’s called umbilical endometriosis where (there’s) bleeding from my bellybutton, bleeding from my navel. And this caused really extreme symptoms,” she said.\n\nThat was more than McNamara could bear and she decided to seek surgical excision in Maine. She left Monday for the procedure.\n\nWhile the treatment is sometimes offered in Nova Scotia, it can come with a lengthy wait.\n\n“I think it’s wonderful that the IWK clinic exists for endometriosis and pelvic pain,” McNamara said referring to a specialized clinic that opened at  IWK Health Centre in 2021. \n\n“The problem, though, is, is that somebody like myself who asked to be referred there, I would have waited two, two and a half, three years to get in.”\n\nInstead, she’s looking at paying $50,000 for the surgery in the United States, which prompted her to max out credit cards and take out a bank loan.\n\nHer friends have been trying to help her through an  online fundraiser.  \n\nOne friend, Kristen Herrington, is also hosting events and auctioning off an art piece at her art gallery, Togetherland.\n\n“It’s a difficult thing for women to talk about in the first place, and then when you’re faced with a life-altering disease that prevents you from carrying on with just the day-to-day,” Herrington said. “This is a discussion we need to be talking about.”\n\nThat’s why McNamara and her friends hope that her story will spread a wider message and bring attention to endometriosis and care.\n\nIt’s a message Dr. Elizabeth Randle, a gynaecologist with the IWK Health Centre, also wants to share. She says the hospital has a multi-disciplinary surgical team that can provide the care, but agrees wait times can be difficult.\n\n“At the governmental level, in terms of allocation of resources, more education, more advocacy can only help,” she said.\n\nIn a statement, the province says a new pelvic health clinic will open in Dartmouth next year, and a $1.6-million investment in gynaecological services is currently improving wait time.\n\nMeanwhile, McNamara says she’s ready to live her life to the fullest, and hopes other women will have that chance too.\n\n“I hope that the government… federal and provincial, sees that there’s just way too many women struggling,” McNamara said.\n\n"},

The new filings claim Combs was abusive to the victims, who have not been named publicly, at various parties and industry events from 1995 to 2021.\n\nTwo of the six lawsuits centre around various “white parties” thrown by Combs, where guests dressed in all white clothing to celebrate the Fourth of July or Labour Day weekend at his home in the Hamptons.\n\nOne accuser said he was 16 at the time of a 1998 party, where Combs allegedly asked him to remove his pants and proceeded to touch the victim sexually, the Washington Post reported.\n\nCombs told the teenager such conduct was a  rite of passage  for anyone attempting to break into the music industry, the filing states. The man, identified only as John Doe, said he complied out of fear and a hope Combs would help him secure a successful future.\n\nThe second White Party allegation comes from a man who said he was hired as security for the event in 2006. The anonymous accuser alleged he was served a drink laced with narcotics. While he was “extremely ill,” the man said Combs raped him in an open van.\n\nIn a statement, Combs’ lawyers denied any wrongdoing and said all of the lawsuits are “clear attempts to garner publicity.”\n\n“In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone—adult or minor, man or woman,” his lawyers wrote.\n\nThe rapper is  expected to be named in more than 100 additional lawsuits , according to lawyers who said their clients’ allegations range from sexual assault and rape to sex trafficking and violent behaviour. The latest lawsuits come from this same pool of filings, led by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee.\n\nCombs, his various business enterprises, the department store Macy’s and the hotel chain Marriott were named as co-defendants in the six new lawsuits.\n\nOne accuser said she was raped by Combs in 2004 after while filming the reality TV show . She said Combs invited her and a friend to an “exclusive” after-party at a Marriott hotel. Upon their arrival, the lawsuit claims one of Combs’ staffers told the two women, “You know what you are here for.”\n\nThe unnamed woman said she was 19 when Combs “fondled, molested and ultimately raped” her in the hotel room.\n\nAnother accuser said Combs sexually assaulted him at Manhattan’s Macy’s flagship store in 2008. According to the lawsuit, Combs was there to promote his clothing line, Sean John, when he cornered the John Doe in the stockroom with three of his bodyguards in tow. The man, who worked for a rival fashion brand, said Combs forced him to perform oral sex as his staffers watched.\n\nCombs allegedly threatened the man’s life if he were to tell anyone about the assault, the filing states. Other accusers said the same, claiming Combs threatened them.\n\nThe fifth lawsuit sees a woman accuse Combs of becoming physically violent and raping her at a party celebrating the release of Notorious B.I.G.’s  music video at Elks Plaza in New York City in 1995.\n\nMost recently, one accuser said he believed he was served a laced drink at a party thrown by Combs in 2021. The man, who said he is a consultant working in the music industry, alleged Combs brought him to a backroom and raped him while he was impaired.\n\nCombs has also denied the racketeering, sex trafficking and prostitution charges against him in an ongoing federal investigation.\n\nLast week, the rapper and his lawyers  accused federal authorities of leaking  the video of  Combs’ physical assault  against his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, among other information, to the press in an alleged attempt to deprive Combs of a fair jury trial.\n\nCombs is still in custody and has repeatedly been denied bail. He was arrested last month.\n\nTwo judges have concluded that Combs would be a danger to the community if he is released. On Friday, an appeals court judge denied Combs’ immediate release from jail while a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals weighs his bail request. One judge deemed Combs a “serious flight risk.”\n\nHe is scheduled to stand trial on the federal charges on May 5.\n\n— \n\n—\n\n"},

Another Ottawa-based diplomat, as well as two consular officials in Toronto and another two in Vancouver, were allegedly involved.\n\nIn a retaliatory move,  India expelled six Canadian diplomats , asking them to leave by Saturday, Oct. 19, and withdrew its own envoy who was named in the RCMP probe from Canada.\n\nRelations between India and Canada have soured since 2023 when Trudeau said Canadian intelligence agencies had credible evidence linking agents of the Indian government to the assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\n Nijjar was murdered on June 18, 2023,  when two gunmen opened fire on his pickup truck when he was leaving Surrey’s Guru Nanak Sikh Temple, where he was president.\n\nFour Indian nationals — Karan Brar, Amandeep Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karanpreet Singh — have so far been charged with murder and conspiracy in Nijjar’s killing.\n\nNijjar, 45, was a well-known activist who fled India and came to Canada in 1997.\n\nHe was a Canadian citizen, a plumber and a prominent leader of the Khalistan movement, which seeks independence for India’s Sikh-majority Punjab state.\n\nThe government of Modi had long accused Nijjar of leading what it calls a terrorist group behind attacks in India, although  no credible evidence  was ever produced.\n\nIndia had repeatedly pressed Canada for his arrest over the years.\n\nThree months after his killing,  Trudeau went public with allegations  that investigators had found credible evidence that Indian government agents may have been involved. India has denied the accusation.\n\nThe  Khalistan movement  is considered a security threat by the Indian government.\n\nThe movement dates back to the conflicts over India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947. Sikh separatists pushed for a homeland in negotiations preceding the partition of India’s Punjab region between the two new countries.\n\nThe separatists said the homeland would be called Khalistan, meaning “the land of the pure,” and that it should be created out of Punjab.\n\nThe Khalistan movement eventually became a bloody armed insurgency that shook India in the 1970s and 1980s. It was centered in the northern Punjab state, where Sikhs are the majority, though they make up about 1.7 per cent of India’s overall population.\n\nThe insurgency lasted more than a decade and was suppressed by an Indian government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.\n\nThere is no active insurgency in Punjab today, but the Khalistan movement has supporters in the state as well as in the Sikh diaspora outside of India.\n\nThe movement has backing among sections of the Sikh diaspora in Canada, which has the largest population of Sikhs outside Punjab, and in Britain, Australia and the U.S.\n\nCanada had asked India to waive diplomatic and consular immunities for the individuals who have now been expelled, so they could be interviewed by the RCMP.\n\nBut according to Ottawa, India has refused to co-operate.\n\nThe mounting tensions come as a federal  foreign interference inquiry  is continuing to investigate allegations of meddling by countries like India and China in the 2019 and 2021 elections, and in Canadian society more broadly.\n\nBoth the Foreign Interference Commission and the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) have ranked India as the second most serious foreign interference threat to Canada, behind only China.\n\n\n\n"},

Noticing a disruption in the crowd, he asked for a doctor to be brought in.\n\nAs the man was treated by medics and taken out on a stretcher, Trump acknowledged how hot the rallies can get and asked for an instrumental version of  to be played over the sound system.\n\nJust as he began to launch back into the Q and A, however, a second medical incident began taking place, and members of the crowd shouted for help.\n\n“It looks like, sir, she’s on her feet and walking out. Let’s encourage her,”  Gov. Kristi Noem  , the moderator for the evening, asked of the crowd as the woman was tended to.\n\n“I know it’s really warm in here. Everybody agrees that it’s really warm in here. We’ve got a lot of people who love America.

Let’s make it into a music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?” he said, requesting that  be played again, this time the rendition sung by  Luciano Pavarotti  .\n\nTrump then suggested they could wrap up the evening with the audience in their seats. He called for the Village People’s  and it blasted through the loudspeakers, the usual signal that Trump is done speaking and is ready to leave. But he remained onstage.\n\nFor the next 40 minutes or so, Trump shimmied and bopped around the stage, to an eclectic playlist of songs from his curated playlist he often talks about — including Sinead O’Connor’s  , Rufus Wainwright’s cover of  and Guns N’ Roses’  .\n\nWhile he briefly spoke at times, the remainder of the town hall was mostly listening to Trump’s playlist. Some attendees began to filter out of the building, but many remained until the end.\n\nFinally, Trump left the stage as  from the musical  played.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung on X called the event a total “lovefest” with everyone “so excited they were fainting” and said “ nobody wanted to leave  and wanted to hear more songs from the famous DJT Spotify playlist!”\n\nTotal lovefest at the PA townhall!

{"title": "Many miscarriages happen in ERs, where care is often ‘suboptimal’: report", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUp to 20 per cent of pregnancies end in miscarriage in Canada, forcing many to seek help in overcrowded emergency departments where they often face long wait times.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10811920/miscarriage-care-canada-emergency-rooms-cmaj-report/", "article": "Up to 20 per cent of pregnancies end in  miscarriage  in Canada, forcing many to seek help in overcrowded  emergency departments  where they often face long wait times and a lack of compassionate support, a new report reveals.\n\nThe report, published Monday in the  Canadian Medical Association Journal  (CMAJ), argues that the absence of timely diagnosis and compassionate care for those experiencing miscarriages in the emergency room can result in significant and lasting psychological effects.\n\n“This is a huge problem. One in four pregnancies ends up with a miscarriage, therefore, the care has to be better,” said co-author Dr. Modupe Tunde-Byass, an ob-gyn at North York General Hospital and associate professor at the University of Toronto.\n\n“A perceived lack of compassion can lead to negative experiences and anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder … which can go on for months and even years after a miscarriage,” she told Global News.\n\nEarly pregnancy loss is defined as an empty gestational sac or a gestational sac with an embryo without fetal cardiac activity before 13 weeks gestation, the authors said. Common symptoms include bleeding, cramping, abdominal or pelvic pain, passage of tissue or a combination of these.\n\nTunde-Byass and her colleagues argue that not only are miscarriages common in Canada, but they are also poorly managed.\n\nThe CMAJ review aims to guide physicians on better diagnosing and managing the condition, advocating for referrals to outpatient early pregnancy assessment clinics (EPACs) and emphasizing the need for a more compassionate approach to care.\n\nEPACs are pregnancy clinics that provide urgent and sensitive care to women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant and experiencing complications such as nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain or cramping. These clinics provide an alternative to the emergency room, allowing patients to receive timely care without the need to wait in the ER.\n\nAlthough EPACs already exist in Canada, Tunde-Byass argues that they are not universally available, and a patient needs a referral to be able to attend.\n\nMany pregnant people experiencing bleeding and cramping seek care in emergency departments, the authors noted. However, for those without major symptoms, like a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or major uterine hemorrhage, this often means enduring long delays in overcrowded waiting rooms before seeing a doctor.\n\n“What we hear from pregnant individuals is that the perception when they go to the ER and they don’t have a lot of symptoms, they perceive that the health-care provider believes they are wasting time and wasting resources,” Tunde-Byass said.\n\nIn an  editorial accompanying the review , Dr. Catherine Varner, an emergency physician and deputy editor of the CMAJ, noted that while the emergency department is the safest and most appropriate place for a pregnant person with severe miscarriage symptoms, such as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, those who are not critically ill often receive suboptimal care in these settings.\n\nIt’s not just the lack of compassion that pregnant individuals experience in emergency rooms, Varner said, it’s the long wait times that can also lead to risks and trauma.\n\nIn 2015, for example, a pregnant woman named Ashley Moisan, who was 10 weeks along,  waited seven hours at a Fort Saskatchewan hospital  seeking help after suffering a miscarriage.\n\nAfter speaking with the nurses in the triage unit, she was informed that the wait would be about two hours and was told to take a seat in the waiting room. Unfortunately, she ended up waiting for seven hours before seeing a doctor.\n\nMoisan acknowledged that it was a busy night at the hospital, but she said she wished they had been offered a more private place to wait. Moisan recounted having to go through the miscarriage in the waiting room, describing the experience as traumatic.\n\nIn 2022, Karindeep Mangat from Surrey, B.C., was nearly five months pregnant  when she began experiencing complications  and went to the hospital for help. She waited two hours to see a doctor for pain relief, only to be told she could go home shortly after.\n\nMangat miscarried shortly thereafter while alone in the hospital, as her husband had left the room to seek assistance. When she informed the staff that she had lost the baby, she was given the option to either take the fetus home or send it to the pathology lab for testing; she chose the latter.\n\nKarindeep noted that while the nurses took the fetus, they didn’t bother to check on her health or look for complications. She also expressed frustration that her mental health was overlooked, as no counselling or support was offered.\n\n“Patients who are early in pregnancy and they start having symptoms of early pregnancy loss often are not quite sure where to seek care. We know that patients in this age demographic are some of the most likely to not have a family physician, and so they often seek care in the emergency department,” Varner said.\n\n“And we know that their care is suboptimal, they have bad experiences. They’re often not given clear discharge instructions, clear instructions of what’s happening. And so the the patients feel that and they feel a lot of guilt about having to rely on the emergency department and then layer on that the psychological distress of losing a pregnancy in this and having symptoms of early pregnancy loss. It’s really, really difficult.”\n\nThe authors recommend referring patients, when possible, to an outpatient EPAC, where health-care professionals are trained to provide comprehensive and compassionate care for those experiencing early pregnancy loss.\n\n“Research from Ontario and British Columbia has shown that EPACs can ameliorate patient experience and have been shown to improve clinical outcomes, reduce repeat assessments in the emergency department, and lead to improved patient satisfaction,” Tunde-Byass wrote.\n\nHowever, these services are lagging, the authors said, which is why many pregnant people seek help in emergency rooms.\n\nVarner said she has spoken with patients who reported being told they didn’t qualify for psychological support or followup care after a miscarriage in the ER because their pregnancy loss happened too early.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of compassion fatigue in emergency departments right now given the state of overcrowding. And I hope this will help us be more attentive to our language in the emergency department setting and the environment that the patients are feeling, especially in the waiting room … such as trying to make that extra effort to get a patient to a private space,” she said.\n\nThere is a need for more EPACs in Canada to ensure that patients receive compassionate care from trained professionals in pregnancy loss, without feeling rushed, the authors argue.\n\n“We just need to expand them. And we also need to make them more available to patients in terms of extended hours. And I think importantly, to remove the need for a referral to an early pregnancy assessment clinic,” Varner said.\n\n\n\n"},

Poilievre has argued that accepting the top-secret briefings would prevent him from asking questions about foreign interference in the House of Commons – something that has not prevented NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh or Green Party Leader Elizabeth May from receiving the information.\n\nPoilievre shot back in a statement Wednesday afternoon, calling on Trudeau to release the names of all MPs that have “collaborated” with foreign governments and accusing the prime minister of lying.\n\n“Furthermore, my chief of staff has received classified briefings from the government. At no time has the government told me or my chief of staff of any current or former Conservative parliamentarian or candidate knowingly participating in foreign interference,” Poilievre’s statement read.\n\n“If Justin Trudeau has evidence to the contrary, he should share it with the public. Now that he has blurted it out in general terms at a commission of inquiry – he should release the facts. But he won’t – because he is making it up.”\n\nJustice Marie-Josée Hogue’s inquiry has previously heard testimony that parliamentarians have “wittingly or unwittingly” participated in foreign interference schemes – evidence that echoes the findings of an all-party national security committee of parliamentarians earlier this year.\n\nBut neither that committee nor Hogue’s inquiry has given any hint about who those parliamentarians are. The only sitting parliamentarian named in evidence before the Hogue commission is Han Dong, the now-independent Don Valley North MP who was elected as a Liberal.\n\n“The fact that we see, and I’m getting a little more partisan than I tried to in this case, but it is so egregious to me that the leader of the official Opposition, who is certainly trying very hard to become prime minister, is choosing to play partisan games with foreign interference and accusations on foreign interference, but not taking it the least bit serious as regards to his own responsibilities as party leader, or even to get top officials within his party briefed up as they bring on candidates from across the country is inexplicable and, quite frankly, concerning,” Trudeau charged.\n\nIn an at-times testy exchange with a lawyer for the Conservative Party, Trudeau dismissed Poilievre’s argument that his chief of staff, Ian Todd, has security clearance and can be briefed on top secret matters.\n\nTrudeau said he “can’t help imagining” how people would react if he delegated the issue to his own chief of staff, Katie Telford.\n\n“Conservative Party members didn’t select Mr. Todd to make decisions about who could run for the Conservative Party of Canada. They expect Mr. Poilievre to take those decisions, but he has decided that he doesn’t want to take those decisions,” Trudeau said.\n\nIn an earlier closed-door interview with the commission’s lawyers, Trudeau talked about the difficulty of the government stepping in when other political parties are under threat from foreign interference.\n\nTrudeau pointed to one case, without specifying when, in which his national security and intelligence advisor gave him information about “significant” foreign interference operations related to an opposition party.\n\n“He told his NSIA, CSIS and others at the time that they need a plan to respond. He said this new information was explosive,” the transcript of his in-camera interview read.\n\n“However, it was not good for a democracy that he use his role as prime minister, while also leader of the Liberal Party, to avail himself of information he obtained about potential (foreign interference) involving opposition parties if it could be perceived as being used to embarrass them. The prime minister was open to guidance from the commission on how best to handle such situations.”\n\nTrudeau added that foreign interference issues need to be dealt with in a way that doesn’t tarnish all MPs and that party leaders need to be held accountable for making their parties “resilient” against foreign actors.\n\nThe prime minister’s testimony comes just two days after Canada declared six Indian diplomatic officials personae non gratae, including the country’s high commissioner, amidst allegations they were involved in dozens of violent crimes across Canada targeting opponents of the Modi government.\n\nSenior sources familiar with the matter told Global News the Indian agents played key roles in a wave of shootings, killings, threats, arsons and extortions on Canadian soil.\n\nThe Modi government has denied the allegations. But Global News reported Tuesday that police have evidence the campaigns were allegedly approved by Amit Shah, India’s second most powerful politician and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe violence mainly targeted members of the Khalistan movement that supports independence for India’s Sikh-majority Punjab. The movement has long been an irritant in Canada-India relations.\n\nWhile the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has been consistently identified by intelligence agencies as the most active player in foreign interference operations, India’s alleged activities on Canadian soil made headlines last year after the assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia.\n\nIn September 2023, Trudeau took the unprecedented step of publicly announcing the Canadian government had credible intelligence linking Indian government officials to Nijjar’s death.\n\n“This was something that we obviously had to take extremely seriously, that violence of sovereignty, of the international rule of law, with extrajudicial killing in a foreign country, in a fellow democracy, was a massive mistake if India had indeed done it and we had reasons to believe that they had,” Trudeau told the commission Wednesday.\n\nTrudeau said Canadian officials attempted to work with their Indian counterparts to investigate Nijjar’s murder but were rebuffed.\n\n“It culminated with a conversation I had with Prime Minister Modi after the end of the last session at the G20 in Delhi, where I sat down, shared that we knew that they were involved and expressed a real concern around it,” Trudeau said of a September 2023 meeting with Modi.\n\n“He responded with the usual response from him, which is that we have people who are outspoken against the Indian government living in Canada that he would like to see arrested. And I tried to explain that freedom of speech and freedom of people who come to our country to be Canadians, to criticize governments overseas or indeed to criticize a Canadian government is a fundamental freedom of Canada.”\n\nTrudeau called the Indian government’s alleged actions a “horrific mistake” and said Canada is considering further action in order to defend its sovereignty.\n\n\n\n"},

He has denied any wrongdoing and is suing Global News’ parent company over its foreign interference coverage.\n\n“I didn’t pay attention to busing international students because … I didn’t understand it as an irregularity,” Dong told the foreign interference inquiry earlier this year.\n\nDong’s campaign manager, Ted Lojko, testified that he didn’t know anything about the busload of students.\n\nWhile Dong was allowed to remain sitting as a Liberal MP for years, the intelligence was of sufficient concern that the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) nixed Dong’s candidacy to sit on the special committee on the Canada-People’s Republic of China relationship, according to Trudeau’s deputy chief of staff, Brian Clow.\n\n“After the (2019) election, the Clerk briefed the Prime Minister, (Chief of Staff Katie) Telford, and (Jeremy) Broadhurst about the intelligence” related to Dong, documents released by the commission Tuesday read.\n\n“However, there was very little information available.… At that point the level of Mr. Dong’s engagement with the (People’s Republic of China) was unclear.… Mr. Clow stated that, around December 2019, the Whip’s Office put Mr. Dong’s name forward for membership on the China-Canada Committee. Because of the concerns that officials had raised, PMO intervened and Mr. Dong was not appointed.”\n\nThe committee was established to examine “all aspects” of the Canada-China relationship, but has focused much of its time examining Beijing’s alleged interference in Canadian affairs and human rights violations by the communist government.\n\nTrudeau had previously told the commission that the 2019 briefings did not have “sufficient or sufficiently credible information” to remove Dong as a Liberal MP, or as a candidate in the 2021 general election when he retained his GTA seat for the Liberals.\n\nAccording to documents published by the inquiry on Tuesday, the PMO decided that Dong would not be “promoted” to cabinet or a parliamentary secretary role after the 2019 election. Dong previously told the commission that meeting with diplomats — including from other countries — was part of his job as an MP.\n\nPMO officials also testified that they expected the intelligence agency to provide “updates” on any new information related to Dong’s relationships with PRC officials.\n\n“Ms. Telford testified there were back-and-forth discussions with intelligence services at the time, including about the fact that it was not uncommon to have buses of supporters in nomination meetings,” one document reads.\n\n“Ms. Telford and the Clerk sought to understand what were the concerns and the intelligence that they were based on.”\n\nThe evidence gets at an issue that has been repeatedly raised during the months-long probe into foreign interference in Canada – differences of opinion between intelligence agencies, who know intelligence-gathering but are not necessarily well-versed in politics, and political veterans who are not necessarily experts in intelligence.\n\nThose debates between intelligence agencies and politicos are particularly pronounced in what has been called the “grey area” between normal, if aggressive, diplomatic behaviour versus interference operations.\n\nIt’s not unusual for foreign countries to collect information about influential political figures in Canada, for instance – and Canadian diplomats do the same thing in countries where they’re posted.\n\nBut the line between collecting information to inform policy and collecting information for leverage or blackmail is not always easy to spot.\n\n“Ms. Telford explained that they often see debates play out between departments (such as Global Affairs Canada and CSIS) and other parts of the government about the difference between diplomatic activity and (foreign interference),” one document read.\n\n“She gave the example of when they are presented with information in a security assessment that an individual is ‘vulnerable’ to a country or High Commission. The individual being vulnerable does not mean they have erred.… This is different from when they are told that an individual is covertly doing something inappropriate with a foreign official.”\n\nAs for Dong’s future with the federal Liberals, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the commission Tuesday afternoon that he will wait for Hogue’s final report before making a recommendation to Trudeau.\n\nTrudeau himself is scheduled to testify at the commission Wednesday, with Hogue’s final report expected by the end of the year.\n\n"},

The drones would appear in the sky about 45 minutes to an hour after sunset each night.\n\nFormer air force general Mark Kelly was first made aware of the drone sightings in December 2023, the outlet reports. They showed up for 17 consecutive days, with officials at the Pentagon suspecting they might have been deployed by Chinese or Russian agents to spy on the American military.\n\nBut because the drones did not pose an imminent threat, and officials at the time weren’t certain if they were being used for nefarious purposes or perhaps it was just wayward hobbyists, the military was prohibited from shooting them down, citing potential risks to troops and civilians.\n\nThe White House met with the Defense Department, the FBI and the Pentagon’s UFO office, as well as outside experts, to discuss what to do about the mystery formations, but several solutions, including shooting nets to catch the drones and using electronic signals to jam their navigation systems, also did not make the cut.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the phalanx of drones  flew in a precise pattern  along the same route each night.\n\nKelly described the first drone he saw as roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 kilometres an hour, at an altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Kelly said as many as a dozen more drones followed behind and said the drones looked like constellations in the night sky.\n\nIt was such an alarming breach that Langley officials cancelled their nighttime training missions and moved their F-22 fighter jets to another base.\n\nAccording to Fox News, two months before the fleet emerged over Langley,  five mysterious drones  reportedly breached restricted airspace over a government nuclear weapons experiment site in Nevada.\n\nThe outlet reports that four of the drones were detected by the Energy Department’s Nevada National Security Site outside Las Vegas, while the fifth was spotted by employees. The Defense Department has yet to publicly state who is behind these drones.\n\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website, “reports of  unmanned aircraft (UAS) sightings  from pilots, citizens and law enforcement remain high.”\n\nThe FAA says it receives  more than 100 UAS reports  a month.\n\n“The agency wants to send out a clear message that operating drones around airplanes, helicopters and airports is dangerous and illegal. Unauthorized operators may be subject to stiff fines and criminal charges, including possible jail time,” the website states, reminding drone operators to review the rules about where and when a drone is safe to fly.\n\nFrom July to September of this year, the FAA recorded more than 400 UAS sightings.\n\n"},

Those are tough marks for the six-foot-five Agbaji, who gives up an inch to Brown and three to Tatum, but the Raptors’ forward is up for the challenge.\n\n“I embrace that every single night,” said Agbaji. “That’s the fun in this, showing up and having those matchups, having the defending champs and knowing that you got to turn it up to a different level.\n\n“It’s just always fun, whatever matchup it is, whether it’s them or Kevin Durant or whoever it is, it’s just always fun to match up with them.”\n\nAgbaji averaged 6.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 1.3 assists in 27 games for the Raptors last season after Toronto acquired him in a trade with the Utah Jazz on Feb. 8.

These findings confirm that maintaining the status quo is not an option. Health care in Ontario needs an innovation revolution. Without it, the system won’t be able to cope.”\n\nIn addition to more people living with major illnesses, researchers predict that the number of illnesses any individual will be living with will also increase significantly.\n\nThey say that conditions expected to increase the most in number are those that increase with age, including osteoarthritis, diabetes and cancer.\n\nResearchers say that having multiple chronic conditions is a major driver of demand for health services and is costly for hospitals.\n\n“Planning for sustainable and equitable health care that’s responsive to emerging trends requires projections of what chronic disease rates are likely to be in the future,” said Adalsteinn Brown, dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and co-author of the study.\n\n“Our projections suggest that more Ontarians will be living with major illness, and the number of cases will rise for many chronic conditions. Given these findings, it’s clear that new solutions are needed now, including significant efforts in chronic disease prevention and management.”\n\nThe study, Projected Patterns of Illness in Ontario, represents the most recent comprehensive public report to quantify chronic disease and multimorbidity in the Ontario population.\n\nResearchers looked at factors like age and sex-specific demographic projections with historical chronic disease trends to model the burden of illness in the population in the future.\n\nCanadians are living longer, with life expectancy growing to 81.5 years as of 2020 to 2022, which researchers say contributes significantly to the estimated increases, along with underlying structural and social determinants of health and an increase in chronic disease risk factors.\n\nThe population of Ontario is also projected to grow by 36 per cent over the next 20 years, with the largest increase happening in the 65 and older age group.\n\nThe study calls on the Ontario health system to take immediate action and to “aggressively focus on prevention, early detection and effective treatment of chronic disease.”\n\nThe study is also calling for Ontario to develop a long-term health services capacity plan, so the province can meet the needs of its rapidly growing and aging population, and to expand services that support and encourage seniors to age at home.\n\n“Over the past several decades it is biomedical and technological innovation that has driven clinical improvements, cost savings and improved access to care in hospital settings,” Dale said.\n\n“And now, artificial intelligence, gene therapy and personalized medicine are demonstrating astonishing potential. Working together and embracing innovation in all its forms, we can create a future with less disease, better treatment and universal access to care. It’s within our reach.”\n\n"},

It sought and was granted a temporary injunction in August.\n\nMichael Phillips, president of United Steelworkers National Local 1944, told Global News last month their members were facing  “extreme stress”  over the move.\n\nPhillips said most of the affected Ontario employees have been working from home for years, and while the majority live in the Greater Toronto Area, the union doesn’t know of any who have expressed a desire to move to Montreal for in-office work.\n\nHe also said the union is unaware of how many members may have applied for other roles at Telus, but added the company has not stated if it would open additional postings for affected employees, or if it would give preference to affected employees in hiring for any existing postings.\n\nAside from offering financial support for those willing to make the move, Merker told Global News last month Telus has offered “financially generous” voluntary separation packages that “exceed the requirements of the Canada Labour Code.”\n\n“We’re confident that our evolved style of serving our customers and investment in our valued team members will enhance our customer service experience,” Merker added on Wednesday.\n\n"},

Listen to their full conversation at the link in our bio.  #jerryseinfeld   #unfrosted   #podtok \n\n  ♬ original sound – The New Yorker  \n\n \n\nNow, Seinfeld is walking back those comments. In an appearance on comedian Tom Papa’s  podcast, Seinfeld insisted he has to “take back” what he said in April.\n\nSeinfeld said it “is not true” that the “extreme left” has suppressed the art of comedy. He used a skiing analogy to illustrate his point.\n\n“If you’re a champion skier, you can put the gates anywhere you want on the mountain and you’re going to make the gate. That’s comedy,” Seinfeld said. “Whatever the culture is, we make the gate. You don’t make the gate, you’re out of the game. The game is where is the gate and how do I make the gate to get down the hill.”\n\nSeinfeld admitted that culture has changed, and there are certainly things he would have said in his comedy act years earlier that are no longer appropriate.\n\n“You can’t say certain words about groups. So what? The accuracy of your observation has to be 100 times finer than that just to be a comedian,” he said.\n\n“It’s not my business to like or not like where the culture is at,” he clarified. “It’s my business to make the gate, to stick with my skiing analogy.”\n\n #JerrySeinfeld  regrets saying this.  #regret   #breakingbreadpodcast   #tompapa   #commentary   #opinion   #comedy  \n\n  ♬ original sound – Tom Papa  \n\n \n\nSeinfeld joked the press coverage and public reaction to his “extreme left” comments was surprising.\n\n“I didn’t know that people care what comedians say,” he laughed. “That came as news to me. Who the hell cares what a comedian thinks about anything?”\n\nSeinfeld further clarified his own comments about performing comedy on college campuses.\n\nIn 2015, Seinfeld (among other comedians) said he avoids  performing standup on college campuses  because students are too politically correct. He fretted college students would misconstrue his jokes as racist or sexist.\n\nSpeaking to Papa, Seinfeld denied ever saying he doesn’t play on campuses, and said he performs for college students “all the time.”\n\n“I have no problem with kids, performing for them,” he said, listing a few campuses where he’d recently completed shows. “I do colleges all the time. So, that perception that I don’t do colleges is just wrong.”\n\nSeinfeld’s April comments about the “extreme left” provoked ample conversation in the comedy space and beyond. Many critics of the comedian’s take pointed to successful TV comedies like ,  and  as proof that the genre is alive and well.\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus, Seinfeld’s longtime co-star, took issue with his take about the state of comedy. During an interview on the  podcast, Louis-Dreyfus called Seinfeld’s comments “bulls—t.”\n\n“There’s a lot of talk about how comics can’t be funny now,” she said. “Physical comedy and intellectual comedy and political comedy, I think, has never been more interesting, because there’s so much to do.\n\n“When I hear people starting to complain about political correctness — and I understand why people might push back on it — to me that’s a red flag, because it sometimes means something else. I believe being aware of certain sensitivities is not a bad thing. ”\n\n"},

None of us did,” said Joan Andersen VanderMolen, victim Kitty Menendez’s sister. “We know that abuse has long effects, and victims of trauma sometimes act in ways that are very difficult to understand.”\n\n“The whole world was not ready to hear that boys could be raped,” she said, adding “today we know better.”\n\nErik Menendez, now 53, and his 56-year-old brother, Lyle Menendez, are currently incarcerated in state prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted of  killing their parents , José and Mary Louise (Kitty) Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion more than 35 years ago.\n\nThe brothers were found guilty 28 years ago and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nWednesday’s news conference  was the largest gathering of the extended family since the brothers’ 1996 sentencing. The brothers’ post-conviction lawyer, Mark Geragos, also joined the family at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center.\n\nGeragos said society’s understanding of sex abuse has changed in the decades since the killings and subsequent trial. He said people have become more aware that men can be victims of sexual assault and abuse in that time. \n\n“If they were the Menendez sisters, they would not be in custody,” Geragos said.\n\nThe gathering, which attracted a large scrum of press, took place less than two weeks after L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón announced his office was looking at the brothers’ case again after new evidence was brought forward.\n\nThe new evidence includes a letter written by Erik Menendez that his lawyers say corroborates the allegations that he was  sexually abused by his father .\n\n“They tried to protect themselves the only way they knew how,” said Brian A. Andersen Jr., nephew of Kitty Menendez. “Instead of being seen as victims, they were vilified.”\n\n“They are no longer a threat to society,” he continued.\n\nOthers in the family echoed similar sentiments. “If Lyle and Erik’s case were heard today, with the understanding we now have about abuse and PTSD, there is no doubt in my mind that their sentencing would have been very different,” said Anamaria Baralt, a niece of José Menendez.\n\nFamily members directed supporters to an online petition,  Justiceforerikandlyle.org , which advocates for the brothers’ release from prison.\n\nAt first, the brothers, who were 18 and 21 years old at the time of the killings, maintained to police they’d stopped by their parents’ house the night of the killings to retrieve Erik’s ID while on the way to a movie and discovered their slain parents.\n\nHowever, Erik eventually confided to his therapist that he and his brother were responsible for the killings and after the therapist shared the information with his wife, the confession eventually made its way to police.\n\n Lyle and Erik  were eventually arrested for the murders and their trial kicked off an era of high-profile, televised criminal trials that captured the public’s imagination through the ‘90s.\n\nDespite defence arguments that José had sexually molested his two sons for years and that they killed their parents out of fear, they were  convicted of first-degree murder .\n\nProsecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any molestation. They said the sons were after their parents’ multi-million-dollar estate. But the brothers have said they killed their parents out of self-defence after enduring a lifetime of physical, emotional and sexual abuse from them.\n\nThey served the first part of their sentences in separate prisons, until they were reunited in 2018 and allowed to serve their sentences in the same facility.\n\nIn recent years, many have questioned whether there might have been a  different outcome for the Menendez brothers  if they stood trial today, given society’s changed understanding of sexual abuse and family violence.\n\nEarlier this month, Gascón said there is no question the brothers committed the 1989 murders, but his office will be  reviewing new evidence  and will make a decision on whether a resentencing is warranted.\n\nThe brothers’ lawyers said the family believed from the beginning they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder. Manslaughter was not an option for the jury during the second trial that ultimately led to the brothers’ murder conviction, Geragos previously said.\n\nThe case has gained new traction in recent weeks after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama .\n\n— \n\n"},

Microsoft concluded the hackers sought to embarrass Israelis and make money.\n\nU.S. officials have accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests against Israel’s conflict with Hamas in Gaza. The Microsoft report said Iranian actors have targeted the U.S. and its Middle Eastern allies like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain because of their perceived support of Israel in the wider Middle East conflict.\n\nNetworks tied to Iran, Russia and China have also targeted American voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false and misleading claims about the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nIranian hackers targeted Donald Trump’s campaign and email accounts of some supporters and stole some material, which the FBI said the hackers unsuccessfully tried to sell to the Democratic campaign. Three Iranian operatives have been charged with the cyber attack.\n\nIran has denied any knowledge of or involvement in cyber activity targeting other countries.\n\n\n\n"},

By the time Trooper was discovered by a highway patrol agent who received a tip, the dog was trapped “in flood waters up to his chest.”\n\nFlorida’s Highway Patrol Troop shared bodycam video of the dog to X on Oct. 9.

He told police he abandoned his dog, originally named Jumbo, while he was travelling to Georgia because he couldn’t find accommodation for his pet.\n\nGarcia could face up to five years in prison if convicted.

Regardless of what Putin wants. We must all change the circumstances so that Russia is forced to peace,” he told lawmakers and top officials.\n\nZelenskyy, who has unrelentingly called for a “fair” end to the war, says his plan is needed to force the Kremlin to negotiate in good faith, though he appeared to acknowledge in his speech that some allies see the war’s end game differently.\n\n“We hear the word ‘negotiations’ from partners and the word ‘justice’ much less often. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but honest (diplomacy),” he said.\n\nHis plan proposed establishing a “comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package” inside Ukraine to protect against threats from Russia and to destroy its military power. He did not elaborate, but said there was an additional secret addendum that he could not disclose.\n\nThe plan, he added, also envisaged a Western role investing in and jointly protecting Ukraine’s natural mineral resources from Russian attacks as well as post-war reconstruction pledges.\n\nThe plan is a major test of the political will of Kyiv’s key allies, who have poured in many billions of dollars of weapons to support Ukraine, while navigating fears of an “escalation” in a war against a nation with the world’s largest nuclear arsenal.\n\nNATO has said Ukraine is heading for membership but has stopped short of issuing an invitation. The alliance’s new chief, Mark Rutte, said the plan was a strong signal, but that he was not able to support it as a whole as things stand.\n\nThe Kremlin said it was too early to comment in detail, but that Kyiv needed to “sober up” and realize the futility of the policies it was pursuing.\n\nRussia’s own war effort has been boosted by what Zelenskyy said were North Korean transfers of arms and personnel. Earlier this year, the West and Ukraine said Iran had sent Russia close-range ballistic missiles, something Moscow denied.\n\nA Ukrainian government official told Global News on background that the alleged actions by North Korea and Iran are “very serious” and added urgency to securing an end to the conflict.\n\n“It’s really high time for partners to take the decisions to make sure that Ukraine wins the war,” the official said.\n\n“Unfortunately, Russia is not willing to participate in any diplomatic solution right now. So having this victory plan (in addition to) having the Peace Formula and the Peace Summit, we believe that it can really make a difference.”\n\nOutnumbered by Russian forces, Ukraine’s weary military has struggled to find a way to stop Moscow’s troops inching forward in the east, seizing devastated village after village and threatening the logistics hub of Pokrovsk.\n\nThe deep uncertainty from the looming change of power in the United States has made the situation harder still and November’s election could propel Donald Trump, who has been consistently skeptical of Ukraine aid, back to the White House.\n\nThe Republican former president has pledged to rapidly end the war before entering office if he is re-elected, an idea that Kyiv’s supporters fear could involve crushing concessions in the name of a quick deal.\n\nZelenskyy said it was imperative Kyiv’s partners remained united.\n\nHe reiterated his months-old request for Western backing to conduct longer-range strikes into Russia, spoke of a “clear list of weapons” and air defenses that were needed and the importance of continuing its operations in Russia, a reference to Kyiv’s surprise incursion in Russia’s Kursk region in August.\n\n“If we start moving on this victory plan now, we may be able to end the war by next year at the latest,” he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he would travel to a summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday to present his plan. He is also set to attend a NATO defense ministers’ meeting on Thursday.\n\nHe already met U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington at the end of the September to discuss it. In a subsequent whirlwind tour of Europe, he met the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany and outlined his plan.\n\nCanadian government officials have also been briefed on the plan, said Oleh Nikolenko, Ukraine’s consul general in Toronto.\n\n“I would say that the feedback that we are receiving right now (from all allies) is positive,” he told Global News.\n\nBiden on Wednesday announced a new US$425 million military aid package after speaking with Zelenskyy the same day. The security package includes air defense capability, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles and critical munitions, the White House said in a statement.\n\nZelenskyy’s speech was attended by his top military, intelligence and political brass as well as lawmakers, some of whom occasionally stood up to applaud, although it was panned by some lawmakers.\n\nOleksii Honcharenko said the plan looked “very unrealistic”: “We put almost everything on our partners. And what demands do we make of ourselves?”\n\nUkrainian officials say the country is already “doing the hardest job” by fighting Russian troops on behalf of its allies.\n\n“We’re paying the highest price,” Nikolenko said. “But we also understand that victory requires joint efforts, not only Ukraine’s efforts, because we are fighting a larger and strongest adversary (and that) also requires support from the international partners.”\n\nRoman Lozynskyi, a lawmaker for Zelenskyy’s party, said it looked “fantastical” but that such past requests – such as for F-16s or Storm Shadow missiles – had once seemed unrealistic but nonetheless yielded results.\n\nZelenskyy’s speech sought to persuade the exhausted public that the war can be ended soon and to emphasize the importance of ordinary Ukrainians remaining united as war challenges pile up.\n\n“We achieved and are achieving results in battles thanks to our unity.

We need them to do the same with regards to vehicle manufacturing in terms of preventative measures against auto theft,” Anand said.\n\nIBC data earlier this month also showed fewer insurance claims by Canadians from January to June, down 19 per cent when compared to 2023.\n\nThe numbers from across the country found car theft claims amounted to more than $544 million, a high number but down roughly 29 per cent relative to the same period last year.\n\nEven with the dip seen, however, the IBC still reported this month that claims and counts remain above “historical levels.”\n\nIn the past 10 years, auto theft claims have gone up 138 per cent and value of those claims has surged by 442 per cent.\n\n"},
{"title": "Inflation’s well in-hand. So why do so many Canadians still feel ‘a squeeze’?", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNew polling on the state of Canadian finances reveals signs of both stress and optimism persist among households despite recent progress taming inflation.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10814566/inflation-financial-stress-canadians/", "article": "News that  inflation  dropped to a more than three-year low in September has not changed the financial picture for many Canadians who continue to struggle with a permanently higher cost of living.\n\nGrowing optimism about the improving economic outlook for some comes as others report the need for ongoing sacrifices and a continual stress about making ends meet, according to new polling released Wednesday.\n\nThe latest MNP Consumer  Debt  Index, based on Ipsos polling from September, reported that nearly a third of respondents (30 per cent) are turning to “bill-splitting” behaviours — spreading out costs with others — in the current  cost-of-living  crunch. That could refer to carpooling, buying in bulk with a group, sharing subscriptions and living with other people.\n\nThose who are cohabitating or splitting bills were more likely to report being close to insolvency, according to MNP.\n\nWes Cowan, licensed insolvency trustee with MNP, tells Global News that he’s seen a “significant increase” in the number of people reaching out for help managing their personal finances in the past six or nine months.\n\n“For the last couple of years or so, we’ve been under greater financial stress with high inflation, higher interest rates,” Cowan says. “People are adapting. I think Canadians are resilient … but there is definitely a squeeze on our budgets.”\n\nOverall, the Consumer Debt Index improved by four points from the previous quarter, suggesting that, in aggregate, Canadians are feeling better about their finances.\n\nTwo in every five Canadian households (42 per cent) still say they’re less than $200 away from insolvency each month, according to the polling. Those are the lowest levels seen in the quarterly survey since September 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly three in 10 (28 per cent) indicated in the MNP survey that they’re eating less overall to cut down on costs.\n\nReports that Canadians are eating less to save money come the same day Statistics Canada reported that food insecurity rose in 2022 as inflation peaked.\n\nThe agency said Wednesday that 15.6 per cent of households experienced some level of food insecurity in 2022 after being relatively stable from 2017 to 2021. The reading was up from 9.6 per cent in 2017 and 11.6 per cent in 2018.\n\nSigns of stress come a day after StatCan said that annual inflation  slowed sharply to 1.6 per cent in September , falling below the Bank of Canada’s target for price stability.\n\nWhile lower gas prices and discounts on clothing and airfare are offering relief to Canadians, StatCan noted that the relatively modest cost of living hikes followed years of surging inflation.\n\nOver the past three years, the consumer price index has risen 12.6 per cent. In some parts of that representative household basket — namely groceries and shelter costs — prices were up more than 20 per cent over the same period.\n\nShannon Terrell, spokesperson and lead writer with NerdWallet Canada, tells Global News that focusing on the monthly and annual inflation figures can sometimes miss the “bigger picture” facing Canadian pocketbooks.\n\n“Although we’re seeing inflation in a better place now, we have to acknowledge by and large that Canadians have been struggling with these raised costs for essentials for a number of years now,” she says.\n\n“While price growth is slowing, overall prices themselves are not decreasing. They’re simply rising at a slower pace. And so the cumulative effect of inflation, especially over the last couple of years, really cannot be understated.”\n\nThe largest fuel in the inflationary file remains rising mortgage interest costs — a direct impact from the Bank of Canada’s rapid rate-hike cycle.\n\nThe central bank has recently started unwinding its policy rate from decades-high levels, delivering three consecutive rate cuts since June. But the cost of borrowing remains elevated, Cowan notes, which is eating up a larger share of the monthly budget for Canadians who hold certain kinds of debt.\n\n“Unless the interest rates come down more substantially over the next little while, they’re still going to have to deal with that,” he says.\n\nRoughly three in 10 (31 per cent) now expect their debt situation to be better a year from now, the MNP survey showed, up two percentage points from last quarter. But nearly half (48 per cent) said that, even if interest rates decline, they’re worried about their ability to pay down their debt.\n\nBoth Cowan and Terrell point to wages as critical to keeping up with the new, permanently higher cost of living.\n\nOn average, hourly wages have outpaced inflation for the past 19 months, according to StatCan.\n\nBut the parliamentary budget officer  said in a report released last week  that not all income levels are sharing in the prosperity. Canadians have lost purchasing power in the face of higher interest rates and inflation since 2022, the fiscal watchdog said, particularly lower-income households.\n\n“People are still playing catch-up. And so that’s taking some time,” Cowan says.\n\n\n\n"},

The next day she killed her mother, Lois McCulllough, 71, with a hammer and a kitchen knife.\n\nDuring the trial, reports The Guardian, prosecutor Lisa Wilding detailed the  hand-built tomb  she built to hide her father’s body in his bedroom, describing it as “composed with masonry blocks stacked together” and “covered with multiple blankets, and a number of pictures and paintings over the top.”\n\n“She concealed the body of her mother, wrapped in a sleeping bag, within a wardrobe in her mother’s bedroom on the top floor of the property,” Wilding continued, describing the days following the murders inside the family’s Essex home.\n\nOnce the bodies were hidden, lawyers argued, McCullough went to increasingly elaborate lengths to convince people her parents were fine.\n\nShe asked relatives to stay away, reports the BBC, and friends were told the couple had  retired and moved away . The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures the year following their deaths helped, in part, to cover up her crimes, the court heard.\n\nThe couple’s family doctor became suspicious after a number of missed appointments over the years and alerted police, who forced entry into the home on Sept. 15, 2023.\n\nBodycam footage from their arrival show officers confronting McCullough in the home, where she admitted to the killings.\n\n“I did know that this would kind of come eventually. It’s proper that I serve my punishment,” she can be heard telling police.\n\nShe added: “Cheer up, at least you caught the bad guy.”\n\nIn custody following her arrest, she went into detail about how she killed her parents.\n\nShe pointed officers in direction of the knife she used to killed her mom, stashed under the home’s stairs, saying it “will still have blood on it, it’s rusted, but it will still have blood traces on it.”\n\nShe also said she had to “build up gumption” to kill her mother.\n\n“I knew I had to get it done.”\n\nRichard Butcher, brother of Lois McCullough, wrote in a victim impact statement that his niece — the defendant — was  “very dangerous”  and what had happened “undermined my faith in humanity.”\n\nThe Independent reports that McCullough had  run up large debts on her parents’ credit cards  while they were still alive and continued to spend their pensions after their deaths, all while living rent-free in the family home.\n\nForged letters showed McCullough had been tricking her parents into thinking they had lost money through scams.\n\nEssex Police said documents found at the address “built a picture of a woman who was trying desperately to keep her parents from discovering the  depth of the financial black hole  she continued to dig, while giving them false assurances about her employment and future prospects.”\n\nAt sentencing, the judge told McCullough that she was close to £60,000 (C$107,000) in debt before the killings and that she grew and maintained an “elaborate, extensive and enduring web of deceit” over months and years.\n\n“I’m sure a substantial motive for each of the murders was to stop your parents discovering you had been stealing from them and lying to them and to take money that was intended for them,” he said, according to The Independent.\n\nMcCullough was sentenced to life in prison, to serve a minimum of 36 years.\n\n"},

Yes, this was a violation of the rule of law,’” Trudeau said.\n\n Responding  to Trudeau’s testimony, the Indian government said Canada had “presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats.”\n\n“The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone.”\n\nBut appearing at the Hogue Commission two days after the RCMP said India was targeting its opponents in Canada with violence, Trudeau detailed his attempts to resolve the dispute with New Delhi.\n\nHe said that while the June 18, 2023, murder of the Surrey, B.C. Sikh temple leader was initially considered a gang or crime killing, indications of India’s involvement emerged over the summer.\n\n“In late July, early August, I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada and possibly Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, credibly clear, that India was involved in this killing,” he said.\n\nCanada first reached out to the Indian officials in August, to inform them of the findings and to try to work together “in a responsible way that doesn’t come and blow up the relationship.”\n\nTrudeau said Canada could have made things “uncomfortable” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi by going public with the allegations before the G20 summit in September 2023 in New Dehli.\n\n“We chose not to,” he said.\n\n“We chose to continue to work behind the scenes to try and get India to cooperate with us,” he said.\n\nBut instead of looking into the conduct of its security agencies, India only wanted to know what Canada had on them.\n\n“And at that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said, ‘Well, you know, let’s work together and look into your security services, and maybe we can get that done,”’ Trudeau said, adding the Indian response was, “No, no, no, we’re not doing that.”\n\nAt the end of the G20, Trudeau said he spoke directly with Modi.\n\n“I sat down and shared that we knew that they were involved, and explained a real concern around it,” the prime minister said.\n\n“He responded with the usual response from him, which is that we have people who are outspoken against the Indian government living in Canada that he would like to see arrested,” he testified.\n\n“And I tried to explain that freedom of speech and freedom of people who come to our country to be Canadians, to criticize governments overseas, or indeed to criticize the Canadian government, is a fundamental freedom of Canada.”\n\n“But as always, we would work with them on any evidence or any, concerns they have around terrorism or incitement to hate or anything that is patently unacceptable in Canada.”\n\nUpon returning to Ottawa, Trudeau said it was obvious India was continuing its approach of attacking Canada instead of dealing with the issue, and he decided to go public with his allegations about India’s role in late September.\n\nOn Sept. 18, 2023, with the Canadian press about to report the story, Trudeau told the House of Commons that security agencies had “credible allegations” of the potential involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar’s killing.\n\n“We determined that it was in the interest of public safety in Canada to let people know that we knew about these allegations, that we were following up on them,” Trudeau told the inquiry.\n\nThe prime minister said he did so partly “to ensure that nobody in Canada, in any communities, felt like they needed to take action themselves, that they should trust Canadian institutions to take this threat seriously and follow up on it.”\n\nThe Indian government again responded to the statement with attacks and denials, instead of cooperation, he said. India also ejected dozens of Canadian diplomats in an act of reprisal, as if to say, “‘We don’t like what you said in the House about us, and we’re going to punish you for that,” according to Trudeau.\n\n“This was a situation in which we had clear, and certainly now even clearer, indications that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty, and their response was to double down and attack Canada further.”\n\nHe said Canada did not want to pick a fight with India, an important trade partner, but he had to stand up for Canadian security and sovereignty.\n\nLast weekend weekend, Canadian officials made another effort to secure India’s cooperation, asking it to lift immunity on six diplomats the RCMP had identified as “persons of interest” in investigations.\n\nIndia declined and launched a broadside early Monday, accusing Trudeau of playing politics. Later that day, the RCMP announced it had uncovered evidence of India’s involvement in a wave of violent crime.\n\nAgents based at India’s high commission in Ottawa and consulates in Vancouver and Toronto had been denying visas to Canadians who needed to travel to India in order to coerce them into spying, sources said.\n\nCash payments were also used to recruit informants. The information they gathered was relayed back to India’s intelligence services, who used it to plan attacks on Modi’s opponents.\n\nIndian intelligence contracted organized crime groups such as the Lawrence Bishnoi gang to carry out the attacks in Canada, which targeted mostly activists in the Khalistan movement that champions independence for the Sikh-majority Punjab.\n\nGlobal News reported Tuesday police have evidence the operation was approved by Modi’s right hand man, Amit Shah, the hardline Hindu nationalist who serves as India’s Home Minister.\n\nAsked if he agreed the violence in Canada was a policy that was “authorized and directed by responsible members of the government of India,” Trudeau said that was “an extremely important question.”\n\n“And that is a question that actually we have been repeatedly asking the government of India to assist us on, and to get to the bottom of, the question of whether it is or could be, rogue elements within the government or whether it was a more, systemic, systematic, endeavour, for the government of India.”\n\nCanadian investigators were “somewhat removed from being able to uncover the internal machinations of the Indian government, of who went wrong or who did this or who did that,” he said.\n\n“That’s why from the very beginning, we have been asking for India, the Indian government to take, these allegations seriously and proceed with their own investigations and work with us on, figuring out exactly how these egregious violations of Canadian sovereignty, actually happened.”\n\n Stewart.Bell@globalnews.ca \n\n"},

A week away from the Toronto Raptors’ home opener, he feels he’s ready.\n\nThe 23-year-old Barnes broke a bone in his hand on March 1, missing the final 22 games of last season after he had surgery to repair it. He now has three pre-season games under his belt with one more exhibition before Toronto hosts the Cleveland Cavaliers at Scotiabank Arena on Oct. 23.\n\n“The way we play and the way we’re going to have to play throughout the season, it’s going to be a lot of hard work,” said Barnes about his preparation level. “We’re going to have to move our bodies so we’ve got to be well rested, get good treatment, make sure we’re getting active with our training staff to make sure our bodies are prepared.\n\n“But conditioning wise, you know, I feel pretty good.”\n\nBarnes has certainly played well in his three pre-season games.\n\nHe had 16 points, eight rebounds, an assist and two steals over 20 minutes in a 113-95 loss to the Washington Wizards on Oct. 11, his first game back after the injury. Two days later he had 10 points, two assists and a rebound in a 115-11 loss in Boston to the Celtics.\n\nMost impressively, Barnes nearly had a triple-double in a 119-118 win over Boston on Tuesday, finishing with 26 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds in 30 minutes, his most playing time in months. Those numbers came against most of the Celtics’ starting five that won that franchise its 18th NBA championship last season, too.\n\nThe Raptors will conclude their pre-season on Friday night in a road game with the Brooklyn Nets. Barnes said the approach was simple before the regular season begins in a week.\n\n“Just staying consistent,” said Barnes on Wednesday after practice at OVO Athletic Centre. “Keep doing what we do, play the right way, playing smart, and just keep being us.”\n\nBackup point guard Davion Mitchell, who has played starter’s minutes with Immanuel Quickley nursing a sprained thumb, had more to say on what Toronto needs to do to be prepared for Cleveland and games that matter.\n\n“I think for us it’s keep learning from each other and keep staying connected on defence, but also finish the possessions,” he said. ” I think the first game we played Boston (on Oct. 13), we didn’t finish a lot of possessions. They got a lot of easy points off just 50/50, balls, second chance points, not boxing out.\n\n“Then we talked about it, we watched film on it, and then we worked on it in practice, and the next game we, I don’t think they had that many second chance points, so we’ve just got to keep talking and keep learning from each other.”\n\nMitchell has been one of the highlights of the Raptors’ pre-season, applying constant defensive pressure on opponents’ ball handlers. He also flirted with a double-double in Tuesday’s win over the Celtics with nine points, 10 assists, three rebounds and a steal.\n\nHe said he wasn’t sure what his role would be on the team when Quickley and swingman RJ Barrett of Mississauga, Ont., return from injury, but said he has had ongoing conversations with head coach Darko Rajakovic about what’s next.\n\n“I know my role is gonna get a little smaller, but I’ll still keep playing to the best of my abilities defensively, get my teammates open, what I’ve been doing the pre-season,” he said.\n\nRajakovic said he expects his players to make the most of the next seven days, both in practice and in Friday’s game in Brooklyn.\n\n“We just need to focus on maximizing every day,” he said. “It’s seven days to the home opener, but for us this whole season, we’ve got to look at this whole season as one big chunk.\n\n“The main focus needs to be for us to play hard, to learn what it means to play hard, and then to have fine-tuning from there.”\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 16, 2024.\n\n"},

He was one of eight players who came off Toronto’s bench as head coach Darko Rajakovic continues to work his team into shape before the home opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Oct. 23.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nCeltics: Boston’s bench beat Toronto 115-111 on Sunday with head coach Joe Mazzulla resting all of his biggest stars. Because Tuesday was Boston’s final pre-season game, he put all of his best-available players out on the court, even if he limited their minutes. Mazzulla said the defending NBA champions hadn’t changed their mindset since beating the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the franchise’s 18th title.\n\nRaptors: Rajakovic said pre-game that he wanted to see his team make better decisions from three-point range. Toronto built a 19-point lead in the first quarter on 71.4 per cent shooting from beyond the arc, scoring 30 points on threes alone to the Celtics’ 27 overall points. But then the Raptors fell behind in the second when none of their eight three-point attempts went in. Toronto went 15 for 43 (34.9 per cent) on its three-point attempts.\n\nKEY MOMENT\n\nBoth teams flushed their benches with seven minutes left to play to limit their starters’ minutes and prevent injuries before the regular season. Toronto held a five-point lead as the reserve players started to come on to the floor.\n\nThe bench players didn’t let up, however.\n\nJD Davison made three free throws in the final two minutes of play for the Celtics. Boston guard Jordan Walsh — who normally plays in the G-League — then tied it 115-115 with 48.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Raptors backup guard D.J. Carton was fouled on the next possession and sank both free throws for a two-point lead. Davison then drilled a 28-foot three-pointer to re-take the lead. Carton made back-to-back free throws with 11.7 seconds left on the clock for the game’s final score.\n\nKEY STAT\n\nBarnes played 30 minutes in only his third basketball game in the past seven months. He needed season-ending surgery after he broke his hand on March 1. Barnes also missed the first game of Toronto’s pre-season for personal reasons. The all-star forward went 10 for 17 on field goals including 5 for 9 three-point shooting.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Raptors visit the Brooklyn Nets on Friday in their final game of the pre-season.\n\nThe Celtics host the New York Knicks next Tuesday in their home opener.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 15, 2024.\n\n"},

The CRA said 185 were looked into, but not fired, though 40 faced disciplinary actions, such as suspension. The remainder of the cases saw administrative actions taken, such as the end of review as the employee was no longer with the agency at the time of review, or were found to be a victim of identity theft.\n\nAnother 135 faced no consequences as they were eligible for CERB, with the CRA telling Global News some of their employees could receive the benefit because they were students or on temporary contracts.\n\nThose that did access CERB inappropriately will be required to pay back the money if they have not already done so, the CRA said.\n\n“The actions of some should in no way undermine the honesty and integrity of the tens of thousands of CRA employees who work every day in an exemplary manner to serve Canadians,” a spokesperson for the CRA said in an email.\n\nThe CRA added that there were still a small number of cases, such as those on medical or extended unpaid leave, who are still being reviewed and will take additional time to complete.\n\n"},

However, September’s  $80 million Lotto Max jackpot was split  between an Ontario winning ticket and one sold in Quebec —  dividing the prize money into $40 million each.\n\n“So far since February, OLG has paid out a combined $400 million in Lotto Max jackpot winnings to lucky Lotto Max players across this province,” OLG said in a news release Wednesday.\n\nThe winning numbers for Tuesday night’s draw according to OLG’s website are: 08, 12, 19, 20, 26, 32, 46 + 27 Bonus.\n\nMeanwhile, several other prizes were also won in Ontario including two maxmillions tickets, each worth $500,000 due to split, sold in Burlington and on OLG.ca.\n\nAn Encore ticket worth $100,000 was sold in Burlington again with another $100,000 ticket sold in Toronto.\n\nLast month, the Lotto Max jackpot hit $80 million and on Sept. 17 there were two winning tickets that split the prize in half. A  couple from Owen Sound in Ontario  got $40 million and a  retired gym teacher from Quebec’s Outaouais region  got the other $40 million.\n\nThe Owen Sound couple, 46 and 47-year-old Stephanie and Bryan Cantwell, said they typically try to play Lotto Max and  Lotto 6/49 once a week , often buying the tickets from a Petro-Canada in Owen Sound where a family friend works.\n\n“I was still in shock, so I checked some other tickets to ensure the app was working properly,” Bryan said.\n\n“I went back to the winning ticket and scanned it again and again. I think I checked it seven or eight times.

He was watching television when he went to buy the ticket online.\n\nHe then made the last-minute purchase with the same lottery numbers he always plays.

The airbag didn’t stop me. When the police arrived, they noticed that my face was bleeding and they called an ambulance,” he recalls.\n\nThe force of the impact pushed his nose back into his skull.\n\nBut he says the time spent healing was nothing compared to what he endured over six years of reconstructive surgeries in Fredericton that he considers failures.\n\nHe waited two years for the first one.\n\n“They did a forehead flap, and that was unsuccessful as far as I was concerned, because I still couldn’t breathe,” Saulnier says.\n\nPhotos show a swollen fleshy mass in the centre of his face.\n\n“They took it off twice to make it smaller to see if they could get it to work,” he remembers, “then I went back and I woke up with no nostrils, it was just one disaster after another. “\n\nAt one point, Saulnier could only breathe through his mouth.\n\nHe didn’t leave his house unless he had to.  He was about to give up.\n\nThen, Saulnier searched for help online and found American prosthetics expert and retired Central Intelligence Agency agent Robert Barron.\n\nIn 2022, Barron welcomed Global News to his Virginia office,  Custom Prosthetic Designs Inc. , where he creates prosthetics for hundreds of people in need.\n\n“I mastered the technique of making silicone look like skin,” he told Global National’s Jackson Proskow.\n\nHis artistry while with the CIA kept operatives safe.\n\n“The disguises had to pass the closest scrutiny, just six to 12 inches,” he explained, “and if they didn’t, their life would be in jeopardy.”\n\nAfter retirement, Barron didn’t stop. He’s been using his skills to help others for 22 years.\n\n“The agency allowed me to come out from undercover to start my humanitarian work,” Barron said in a recent Zoom interview.\n\nAt 82 years old, Barron has changed the lives of domestic violence victims, cancer patients and crash survivors with his hyper-realistic work.\n\n“The people that I’ve helped, when they leave the office, they’ve got a genuine smile on their face. They say, ‘What can I do to just thank you?’”\n\nBarron continues, “I say, ’You’ve already thanked me with that smile on your face.’”\n\n \n\nSaulnier was thrilled when the ex-spy responded to his email.\n\nBarron consulted with Fredericton surgeon Dr. Benjamin Hoyt to have the work from previous surgeries on Saulnier’s face removed.\n\nHe spent a week with Barron in Virgina this past July so the ex-spy could mold, craft and fit the 60-year-old’s new prosthetic nose.\n\n“I put that mirror up and he looked and he just couldn’t believe it,” chuckles Barron. “And I said, well, let’s go up to the bigger mirror!”\n\nNow when Saulnier gets ready in the morning, he feels like a new man.\n\n“I got a 100 per cent smile on my face. Every day. It’s great. I can walk into a store with a smile, not worried about who’s looking at me or who’s staring,” he says.\n\nThe New Brunswicker is now living his life out of hiding, thanks to a man gifted with a talent for concealment.\n\n"},

People are desperate, infrastructure does not work as well when there’s a crisis,” he said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\n“A lot of what we saw globally when we compared (pandemic) responses suggests that the preparedness is the critical part.”\n\nThe report said the “absence of pre-existing emergency protocols for science advice in Canada caused significant delays” and better co-ordination was needed “within and across all levels of government.”\n\nHaving scientific advisory groups federally and provincially communicating separately “resulted in multiple streams of advice,” said the report, which was released on Friday.\n\nThe report by the independent panel of experts was requested by Health Canada.\n\nRazak said there were some aspects of Canada’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to be proud of, including using wastewater surveillance to detect how much of the virus was present in communities.\n\n“We were one of the pioneering countries and we certainly advanced it at scale beyond what many other countries were able to achieve,” he said.\n\nBut some provinces, including Ontario, have now made significant cuts to their wastewater surveillance programs, leaving many communities with “almost no data,” Razak said.\n\n"},

That is an annual increase of 4.7 per cent relative to 2023.\n\nFor every child aged six to 17 years, the maximum CCB payment will be $547.50, which is a 4.7 per cent increase from last year.\n\nFamilies will get the maximum amount for each child if their adjusted family net income is under $36,502.\n\n“The payments gradually start decreasing when the adjusted family net income is over $36,502,” the  CRA states on its website. \n\nFamilies whose total benefits for the year are less than $240 would have received a lump sum amount in July and therefore won’t be getting anything this month.\n\nTo be eligible for the CCB payments, a person must reside in Canada with a child who is under the age of 18 years and must be their primary caregiver.\n\nThe CCB can also be paid out for a foster child as long as the children’s special allowances (CSA) are not payable in a given month, the CRA says.\n\nIf parents share custody of a child, then they each would get 50 per cent of the benefits.\n\nThe payments go directly into bank accounts or cheques are mailed out.\n\nThe benefits will likely be well-received by Canadian families still strapped for cash  even as inflation cools  and  interest rates  start to trend lower,  according to recent Ipsos polling conducted exclusively for Global News. \n\nThe next CCB payments will go out on Nov. 20 and Dec. 13.\n\n"},

Inflation sank to 1.8% in September, the first time in three years that it has been below the ECB’s target rate of 2%.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the decision, the ECB said recent economic evidence shows that “the disinflationary process is well on track.” However, it predicted an inflation pick-up in the coming months, before a return to its target in the course of next year.\n\nThough the bank did not signal that it would cut interest rates again at its next meeting in December, analysts think mounting evidence of an economic slowdown in the eurozone will prompt it do so. All eyes will be on ECB President Christine Lagarde at her press conference later Thursday.\n\n“The trends in the real economy and inflation support the case for lower rates,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\nOne reason why inflation has fallen around the world — it’s down at 2.4% in the U.S. and 1.7% in the U.K. — is that central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nThe ECB, which was created in 1999 when the euro currency was born, started raising interest rates in the summer of 2021, taking them up to a r ecord high of 4% in Sept. 2023 to get a grip on inflation by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, but that has come at a cost by weighing on growth.\n\nOther central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, have also started to cut interest rates as inflation rates have fallen.\n\n"},

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment.\n\nCombs, 54, remains incarcerated without bail after his Sept. 16  federal sex trafficking arrest . His lawyers have asked a federal appeals court to let him be freed to home detention so he can more easily meet with lawyers and prepare for trial.\n\nSo far, judges have concluded he is a danger to the community and cannot be freed.\n\nThe request to identify accusers comes a day after  six new lawsuits  were filed against Combs anonymously to protect the identities of the alleged victims. Two of the accusers were identified as Jane Does while four men were listed in the lawsuits as John Does. The lawsuits claimed he used his fame and promises of boosting their own prospects in the music industry to persuade victims to attend lavish parties or drug-fuelled hangouts where he then assaulted them.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Monday’s lawsuits are part of what their lawyers say is a group of  more than 100 accusers  who are in the process of taking legal action against Combs.\n\nIn their letter Tuesday to Judge Arun Subramanian, lawyers for Combs said the case against their client is unique in part because of the number of accusers. They attributed the quantity to “his celebrity status, wealth and the publicity of his previously settled lawsuit.”\n\nThat reference appeared to cite a November lawsuit filed by his former girlfriend, Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day, but its allegations of sexual and physical abuse have followed him since.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did.\n\nCombs’ lawyers said the settlement of Cassie’s lawsuit, along with “ false inflammatory statements ” by federal agents and Combs’ fame have “had a pervasive ripple effect, resulting in a torrent of allegations by unidentified complainants, spanning from the false to outright absurd.”\n\nThey said the lawsuits filed Monday, along with other lawsuits, and their “swirling allegations have created a hysterical media circus that, if left unchecked, will irreparably deprive Mr. Combs of a fair trial, if they haven’t already.”\n\nThe lawyers wrote that the government should identify alleged victims because Combs has no way of knowing which allegations prosecutors are relying on in their accusations in an indictment.\n\n“To the extent Mr. Combs is forced to mount a defence against criminal allegations that the government does not seek to prove at trial, he is entitled to know that,” the lawyers said.\n\nThe indictment alleges Combs coerced and abused women for years, with the help of a network of associates and employees, while using blackmail and violent acts including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings to keep victims from speaking out.\n\n"},

All I do is report,” Trump replied during the event held in Miami, sharing no sources other than claiming it has been reported in “newspapers.”\n\n“I was there, I’m going to be there and we’re going to take a look.”\n\nIn recent weeks, the former president has amplified the false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, have been  stealing pets from residents  and capturing wildlife from local parks to kill and eat as food.\n\nIn September, when he squared off against Vice-President Kamala Harris for the  presidential debate , he first pushed the narrative, claiming without evidence: “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating — they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” he said at the time, his remarks instantly going viral and leading to  bomb threats being issued  against the city.\n\nPressed by the moderator, Trump said he saw people on television who said “their dog was eaten by the people that went there.”\n\nLocal officials and statewide leaders in Ohio, including Republicans, have made it clear on numerous occasions that there is  no credibility to such claims .\n\nTrump, who has not yet travelled to Springfield, has previously said he would  conduct mass deportations  of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the vast majority of them are in the U.S. legally.\n\nBut, on Wednesday, he dodged and dismissed questions about his plans concerning immigrants.\n\nWhen one undecided voter asked who would do the job of harvesting America’s fruit if Trump followed through with his plan to oust, en masse, the undocumented workers who currently do the job, he sidestepped the question.\n\nInstead, he accused newer immigrants to the country of stealing jobs from Hispanic and African Americans and described migrants across the U.S. border with Mexico as “hundreds of thousands of people that are murderers, drug dealers and terrorists.”\n\n“We have to have people that are great people come into our country,” he said. “I want them in even more than you do.”\n\nTrump has previously said that the Haitian migrants, despite being in the U.S. legally under Temporary Protected Status, are “illegal immigrants as far as I’m concerned,” saying he would revoke their status and deport them if he wins another term in November.\n\nTrump has been attempting to make inroads with America’s Latino population and polls show he’s gaining ground in the diverse voting bloc, many who live in crucial swing states like Arizona and Nevada. However, polls show that Harris still has an advantage with Latino voters, who have typically backed Democrats in the past.\n\nHarris led Trump by eight percentage points – 47 per cent to 39 per cent – among Hispanic voters in  Reuters/Ipsos polling  conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7. Harris held her own Latino town hall last week in Nevada, a battleground state with a significant Hispanic population.\n\nNow, the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more of the Hispanic vote, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.\n\nTrump has previously used dehumanizing terminology to describe immigrants in the U.S. illegally, calling them “animals” when talking about alleged criminal acts, and saying they are “poisoning the blood of our country,” a phrase that has drawn criticism as xenophobic and echoing Nazi rhetoric.\n\nAnother town hall participant, a Florida-based Republican, said he wanted to give Trump a chance to “win back his vote” given his concerns over the Jan. 6, 2021,  Capitol riot  and former Trump administration officials turning against the former president.\n\nThousands of Trump supporters rushed the Capitol in Washington, D.C., that day in a bid to  stop formal certification of his election defeat , causing millions of dollars in damage. Four people died on the day of the attack, and one Capitol Police officer who fought against the rioters died the next day.\n\nTrump gave a lengthy response in which he described Jan. 6 as a “day of love” and said former administration officials who had turned against him were angry about having been fired.\n\n“I hope someday maybe we’ll get your vote,” Trump said as he wrapped up. “Sounds like maybe I won’t, but that’s OK too.”\n\n— \n\n"},

Lange & Söhne watch from Luxury Bazaar, which bills itself as a dealer of pre-owned luxury watches. He returned to Montreal the same day but failed to declare the watch to customs, the judgment says.\n\nSeparately, Blouin had the empty watch box shipped to Canada by FedEx. He claimed he planned to pay duties when the package was delivered to him, but agents from the Canada Border Services Agency found that the manifest accompanying the package showed a value of just six dollars.\n\nThey issued Blouin a fine of $34,650, or 30 per cent of the watch’s value.\n\nBlouin, who owns a transport and logistics company in Montreal, challenged the fine in Federal Court, claiming the decision was unreasonable and didn’t take into account the particular circumstances of his case. He claimed to have previously imported other, less expensive watches and paid duties when they were delivered to him. He said he planned to do the same thing this time.\n\nBut Grammond didn’t buy the story, since Blouin flew back to Montreal carrying this watch, while the package sent by courier was declared to be worth almost nothing. He said a border official had noted that bringing undeclared goods into the country and sending the packaging or invoice by mail is a familiar scheme known to the agency.\n\n“In short, there is no reason to believe that Mr. Blouin intended to declare the watch, or that the whole affair was nothing more than a misunderstanding,” the judge wrote.\n\nNow, on top of the fine and sales tax, Blouin is also on the hook for the government’s legal fees.\n\n"},
{"title": "What is diplomatic immunity, which India refused to waive for expelled agents?", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough diplomatic immunity is meant to be reciprocal between countries, it also means diplomats may never face accountability for alleged criminal actions on foreign soil.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10814657/canada-india-diplomatic-immunity-explained/", "article": "When Canadian officials announced this week it had expelled six Indian diplomats for alleged links to criminal activity targeting Canadian citizens, they said the action was taken after  India  refused to waive diplomatic immunity.\n\nThat immunity shields foreign diplomats from criminal proceedings, including questioning by police in an investigation.\n\n Global News reported that  agents working out of India’s high commission in Ottawa and consulates in Vancouver and Toronto were allegedly behind dozens of violent crimes across Canada that targeted opponents of the Narendra Modi government.\n\nCanada expelled the six Indian diplomats, including the high commissioner, after the RCMP and government officials made their investigative findings public Monday.\n\nIndia swiftly retaliated by ordering six Canadian diplomats to leave the country by Saturday.\n\nThe revelations come as Canadian law enforcement continues to probe the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C., where the killers were allegedly tied to Indian government agents.\n\nAlthough diplomatic immunity is meant to be reciprocal between countries, it also means diplomats may never face accountability for alleged criminal actions on foreign soil.\n\n“Canada’s options are very limited,” said Akaash Maharaj, a senior fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto.\n\nAt its core, diplomatic immunity is a principle of international law that allows diplomats to gather, share and communicate information without fear of criminal prosecution under local laws.\n\nThe Vienna Conventions of 1961 and 1963 outlining international standards of diplomatic immunity note the concept dates back to ancient times, which recognized that messengers were allowed to travel from tribe to tribe without fear of harm.\n\nMore than 160 countries are signatories to the Vienna treaties, including Canada and India. Those countries each have their own domestic laws that outline their commitment to the conventions.\n\n Under Canada’s Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act , individuals accredited as “diplomatic agents” are granted full diplomatic immunity from arrest, detention and the legal process.\n\nThat means they cannot be arrested, detained or compelled to provide evidence or testimony, and are fully immune from the criminal or civil legal process. They are also not subject to searches of their office, residence or vehicle, or personal and baggage searches at airports.\n\nHowever, those officials are still obligated to observe and respect the laws and regulations of the host country.\n\n“Diplomatic immunity is not meant to benefit individuals personally; it is meant to ensure that foreign officials can do their jobs,”  the U.S. State Department says. \n\nOther lower-ranking consular and diplomatic staff have limited protections that grant them immunity only over their official duties.\n\nLast October, shortly after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first made public the allegations about the Indian government’s ties to Nijjar’s murder, Canadian officials said the government had recalled 41 diplomats and their families from New Dehli after India said it would “unilaterally” remove their immunities.\n\nForeign Minister Melanie Joly said at the time such an action was a violation of international law and created ” security implications” for those diplomats.\n\n“If we allow this norm to be broken, no diplomat anywhere would be safe,” she said in a statement.\n\nUnder international law, if an immune diplomat breaks the law of their host country, that country can ask the other to withdraw diplomatic immunity for that official.\n\nIf that country refuses, the host can expel the diplomat — which is what Canada did this week.\n\nIt would then be up to the host country to decide how — or if — it wants to punish their diplomat.\n\nExpelled foreign diplomats have faced punishment in the past for actions on Canadian soil once back home.\n\nIn 2001, a Russian diplomat was driving drunk in Ottawa when he drove his vehicle onto a sidewalk and struck two women, killing one of them. He cited his diplomatic immunity in refusing to take a breathalyzer.\n\nAlthough Moscow refused to waive his immunity at Canada’s request, the diplomat was fired upon his expulsion to Russia, and was later charged and convicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter.\n\n“That was a case where the home government felt embarrassed by a diplomat who did something on his own behalf,” Maharaj said.\n\nHe said the Indian case, by contrast, involves higher-ranking diplomats accused of acting on orders from the Indian government — allegations it has strenuously denied.\n\n“There’s very little that (Canada) can do unless the (Indian) government is prepared to throw its diplomats under the bus, which it isn’t prepared to do in this case,” he said.\n\nMaharaj said Canadian victims and their families could pursue civil cases against the Indian agents once they return to India, but that process would likely take years. So would waiting for a new government to replace Modi’s and allow criminal proceedings to take place.\n\nUnder the international rules for diplomacy, it is up to host countries to decide whether to admit entry to all foreign diplomats.\n\nThat means that, other than expelling officials accused of criminal activity, Canada could choose to simply not admit any replacements from India until the diplomatic row is resolved.\n\nAlthough Indian consular offices in Canada would remain open and staffed, such an entry freeze would ensure those in charge of diplomatic missions would not be subject to the same broad immunity as the diplomats who were expelled, Maharaj said.\n\nA similar arrangement was proposed to Iran in 2016 when the Trudeau government attempted to re-normalize diplomatic relations with Tehran, which ultimately refused the compromise.\n\nBeyond that, Canada will have to rely on its allies to exert pressure on India to co-operate in the Canadian investigation. Both the United States and  Britain have urged India to do so. \n\n"},

With our intelligence help, the IDF relentlessly pursued Hamas’s leaders, flushing them out of their hiding places and forcing them onto the run,” Biden said in a statement.\n\n“Today, however, proves once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice, no matter how long it takes.”\n\nSinwar has topped Israel’s most wanted list since the attack, and his killing strikes a powerful blow to the militant group. There was no immediate confirmation from Hamas of his death.\n\nBiden said DNA tests confirmed Sinwar was dead, with the military saying the body was among three militants killed Wednesday during operations in Gaza.\n\n“To my Israeli friends, this is no doubt a day of relief and reminiscence, similar to the scenes witnessed throughout the United States after President Obama ordered the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden in 2011,” Biden added.\n\n“Israel has had every right to eliminate the leadership and military structure of Hamas. Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7.”\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz called the killing a “military and moral achievement for the Israeli army,” adding it would create the “possibility to immediately release the hostages.”\n\nAir Force Maj.-Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, said its forces had no role in the Israeli operation, even if its intelligence had contributed to Israel’s understanding of Hamas leaders who took hostages last year.\n\n“This was an Israeli operation. There (were) no U.S. forces directly involved,” Ryder said.\n\nIn his statement, Biden said he would be speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders to congratulate them and discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home to their families “and for ending this war once and for all.”\n\nNetanyahu, in an address from Jerusalem, said Sinwar’s death provided the chance for peace in the Middle East, but cautioned that the conflict was not over and Israel would continue until its hostaged were returned.\n\n“Today we have settled the score. Today, evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,” he said in a recorded statement. “To the dear hostage families, I say: this is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.”\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also commented on Sinwar’s death, saying it delivered a “measure of justice” for his victims and families.\n\n“Sinwar’s death ends a reign of terror. Hamas must lay down its arms, release the hostages, and play no future role in the governance of Gaza,” Trudeau said in a post on X. “We repeat our call for an immediate ceasefire. The suffering in Gaza must end.”\n\nIn the hours following Sinwar’s death, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. wants to kickstart talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza\n\n“That obstacle (Sinwar) has obviously been removed. Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,” he said.\n\nSinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel has vowed to kill him since the beginning of its retaliatory campaign in Gaza. He has been Hamas’ top leader inside the Gaza Strip for years, closely connected to its military wing while dramatically building up its capabilities.\n\nAn Israeli security official said it appeared that the man who turned out to be Sinwar was killed in a battle, not in a planned targeted airstrike.\n\nPhotos circulating online showed the body of a man resembling Sinwar with a gaping head wound, dressed in a military-style vest, half buried in the rubble of a destroyed building. The security official confirmed the photos were taken by Israeli security officials at the scene. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe Israeli news site N12 said Sinwar appears to have been killed by chance in a battle on Wednesday. It said that troops tracked a group of militants into a building, then attacked the militants with tank fire, causing the building to collapse. As troops unearthed the dead militants, they noticed that one appeared to resemble Sinwar.\n\nSinwar was imprisoned by Israel from the late 1980s until 2011, and during that time he underwent treatment for brain cancer – leaving Israeli authorities with extensive medical records.\n\nU.S. officials have been in close contact with Israeli officials throughout Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official.\n\nSinwar was chosen as Hamas’s top leader in July after his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas’ military wing Mohammed Deif in an airstrike, but the group has said he survived.\n\nThe report of his death came as Israeli forces continued a more than week-old major air and ground assault in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. On Thursday, an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least 28 people, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry.\n\nFares Abu Hamza, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north, said the dead included a woman and four children, correcting an earlier report of five children. He said dozens of people were wounded.\n\nThe Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza to eliminate Hamas after the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nIsrael’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the current conflict, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of its military campaign, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals.\n\nIsrael allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after  the United States warned it might reduce its military aid  if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations.\n\n\n\n"},

Vandal was named northern affairs minister in 2019, while Tassi has served multiple cabinet roles since 2018, including as seniors minister and labour minister.\n\nAs well, a senior government source says National Revenue Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Sports Minister Carla Qualtrough — both of whom have been in cabinet since the first Liberal government was elected in 2015 — are also not running for re-election.\n\nQualtrough had previously told Global News as recently as last week she planned to run again.\n\nThe source said all four calls were made “weeks ago” and that they were “planned and personal.”\n\n“The situation is that it’s important that I’m closer to home, so that’s completely what this decision is rooted in,” Tassi told Global News in an interview.\n\n Tassi was shuffled to her most recent cabinet position in 2022  after her husband suffered two strokes the year before, which prompted her request to spend more time in her Southern Ontario riding.\n\n In a statement posted to social media , Vandal, who is Métis and the only Indigenous person in Trudeau’s cabinet, commended Trudeau for “unmatched” steps the government has taken with Indigenous people toward reconciliation.\n\n“I fully support your continued leadership as Prime Minister,” he wrote.\n\nTwo other ministers,  Seamus O’Regan  and  Pablo Rodriguez , resigned from cabinet earlier this year. Seven more MPs have left Parliament entirely, including past cabinet members Carolyn Bennett, David Lametti and Marc Garneau.\n\nWith so many cabinet departures, Trudeau will have to draft in more fresh faces from the Liberal backbenches to fill the newly vacant cabinet posts. Many existing cabinet members have been given additional portfolios to juggle.\n\nThe departures of Bennett and Lametti led to byelections for their respective Toronto and Montreal-area ridings that the Liberals lost after holding them for decades — further darkening the Liberals’ prospects for the next election.\n\nAt least two Liberal MPs have  publicly said it’s time for Trudeau to step aside  and make way for a new leader. A growing internal revolt is also playing out in private,  Global News has also learned , with up to 30 MPs signing a secretive document urging Trudeau to go.\n\nThe document has not been signed or even circulated among cabinet ministers, who have unanimously stood by Trudeau in public.\n\nThe revolt is expected to be discussed at the next Liberal caucus meeting on Wednesday.\n\nOne Liberal MP, Chandra Arya, wrote an email this week to caucus viewed by Global News urging his colleagues trying to unseat Trudeau to stop and consider the damage it may create.\n\n“I foresee a vicious battle for leadership which will fracture the fragile party structure with vastly different ideas and personalities,” Arya wrote. “The results will be disastrous.”\n\nThe Liberals  also had to replace the party’s national campaign director  after he resigned last month.\n\nThe government has survived two confidence votes put forward by the Conservatives since Parliament returned in mid-September, but the Bloc Québécois has given the Liberals until the end of October to meet its legislative demands or lose its support in future confidence motions.\n\nThe Conservatives have vowed to keep introducing matters of non-confidence at every opportunity until the House of Commons breaks for Christmas.\n\n\n\n"},

The 25-year-old guard has missed Toronto’s first four tune-up games with a sprained thumb but stayed busy reviewing film, working out, and doing what he could on the court.\n\n“Just trying to find different ways to get better, different ways to help other guys get better,” Quickley told reporters after practice. “We have a lot of rookies. Every time somebody has to sing ‘Happy Birthday,’ it’s like seven or eight rookies.\n\n“I have an obligation to help seven or eight guys any time I get a chance. So I try to do that.”\n\nQuickley has been a constant presence throughout Raptors training camp and Toronto’s pre-season. He was often seen at OVO Athletic Centre doing drills, always with a cast on his left hand.\n\n“I had like four or five different casts to try out, just trying to find a good one that can protect me,” he said. “Feel pretty good, otherwise.\n\n“I’m just trying to get my wind back and stuff like that, try to get my legs under me.”\n\nQuickley was asked directly if he could play a game with the cast on but he was unsure.\n\n“Still questionable for (Friday), to be honest. But we’ll see,” he said. “See how I feel tomorrow. Went through practice today.”\n\nRaptors head coach Darko Rajakovic said that Quickley has been cleared for all practice and team activities but coaches would be cautious about putting him into Friday’s last pre-season game or resting him until Wednesday’s regular-season home opener.\n\n“We’ll see how he feels (Friday), if he’s going to be available for the game or not,” said Rajakovic. “If he does play, I don’t want to put too much on him and too many minutes.\n\n“We’re going to be smart to build him. It’s one thing to work out with coaches, and a different thing to go in and really compete in NBA games.”\n\nQuickley moved over to point guard after the Raptors acquired him on Dec. 30 in a trade with the New York Knicks. He averaged 18.6 points, 6.8 assists and 4.8 rebounds in 38 games for Toronto in that new role last season.\n\nHis performance as a point guard was so impressive that the Raptors re-signed Quickley to a five-year, US$175 million contract on July 8. The deal confirmed that Quickley, all-star forward Scottie Barnes and swingman RJ Barrett of Mississauga, Ont., are considered the team’s future.\n\n“He had a different role on a different team and he came to us in the middle of the season. I think this year (the goal) is for him to stabilize,” said Rajakovic. “He does not have to worry about anything else but getting better on the court and getting better offensively and defensively.\n\n“His mindset is the right one. He understands what he needs to do.”\n\nToronto visits the Brooklyn Nets on Friday to close out its pre-season. Whether Quickley plays in that exhibition or not, Rajakovic is glad to get in one more game before the regular season begins on Wednesday when the Raptors welcome the Cleveland Cavaliers to Scotiabank Arena.\n\n“Every game is of huge importance for us,” he said. “We are a very young team. We need all those reps, we need all of those experiences, we need all of those learning moments.\n\n“I’m glad that we’re playing another road game … We need to learn what it takes to play on the road as well.”\n\nBarrett (sprained shoulder), forward Bruce Brown (arthroscopic surgery on right knee) and rookie combo guard Ja’Kobe Walter (sprained shoulder) remain out.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 17, 2024.\n\n"},

Paramedics arrived at the scene, but Payne suffered “extremely serious injuries,” including a skull fracture, local health officials said. Resuscitation was not possible.\n\nAn  autopsy report  released Thursday revealed Payne died of multiple serious injuries and “internal and external bleeding” as a result of the balcony fall. The report alleged that alcohol, drugs and destroyed furniture were discovered in Payne’s hotel room.\n\nBefore his death, a hotel employee contacted local emergency services to report a guest who had “overindulged on drugs and alcohol.” Though the employee never identified Payne by name, a  transcript of the call  said staff requested urgent help about a guest “breaking” things in their room.\n\nThe hotel employee told 911 they were “afraid” the unnamed man “might do something life-threatening” because there was a balcony in his suite.\n\nPayne’s body was found in the hotel’s courtyard. TMZ was the first North American outlet to report news of his death and shared several cropped photos of Payne’s body — a decision highly criticized by fans and celebrities alike, who have accused the tabloid of being “ morally decrepit .” TMZ has since removed the photos from coverage of Payne’s death.\n\nSince then, speculation and misinformation surrounding the singer’s death have swirled online, including a bogus video of a man purported to be Payne falling from a window circulating on social media.\n\nArgentinian authorities do not believe Payne’s death is suspicious and are continuing to investigate.\n\nTwo weeks ahead of his death, Payne attended a stadium concert for his fellow One Direction bandmate Niall Horan in Argentina.\n\nPayne engaged with fans from a private box in the arena and danced along to the pre-show playlist. Recordings of the star at Horan’s show went viral on social media and brought on mass criticism and cyberbullying for Payne, who some claimed was seeking attention.\n\n@Liam Payne en el movistar Arena  #onedirection   #niallhoran   #argentina  \n\n  ♬ sonido original – Karina Meza  \n\n \n\nIn a video ahead of the show, Payne said on Snapchat that he was hoping to talk to Horan after the concert “to square up a couple of things.”\n\n“No bad vibes or anything like that,” he clarified. “But just we need to talk.”\n\nThe former boy banders reunited backstage, and Payne posted a photo with Horan to his Snapchat account on Oct. 2.\n\nPayne’s girlfriend Kate Cassidy shared an edited video of compiled footage of the couple and their friends at Horan’s show.\n\nSuch a fun show (:\n\n  ♬ Must Be Love – Niall Horan  \n\n \n\nPayne and Cassidy stayed in South America to vacation after attending Horan’s concert.\n\nHe documented much of his trip on social media.

As of this writing, she has not commented publicly on Payne’s death.\n\nLol this is chaiotic\n\n  ♬ original sound – Kateecass  \n\n \n\nIn the weeks leading up to his death, Payne was reportedly  served a cease-and-desist  from his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry, who alleged Payne had repeatedly contacted her.\n\nHenry published a book called in May. The writing is “inspired by true events” and tells the story of a hopeful model who falls in love with a boy band member.\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, Henry said she had “very similar” experiences to the book’s main character, including suffering  complications during an abortion . Henry’s book character is encouraged not to seek treatment for hemorrhaging during an abortion over fear of being spotted publicly and beginning tabloid speculation.\n\nPayne and Henry got engaged in 2020 but called off the plans in April 2022.\n\nIn a TikTok video posted Oct. 6, Henry said Payne  regularly contacted her from different phone numbers and emails  in the years after their breakup. She said Payne would also often contact her mother and “blow up” her phone.\n\nDuring a podcast appearance this week, before Payne’s death, Henry tried to clarify the line between fact and fiction in her book and said she “just wanted to tell her story.”\n\nLink in bio! @The Internet is Dead @brittany @sameera \n\n  ♬ original sound – Maya Henry  \n\n \n\n \n\nOutside the CasaSur Hotel on Wednesday night, emotions were high as fans gathered to light candles and softly sing One Direction songs.\n\nHundreds of teary-eyed fans surrounded the Palermo-region hotel as news of the singer’s death was breaking.

The boyband would go on to reach incredible heights of international fame and success.\n\nUntil One Direction announced its hiatus in 2015, Payne’s face could commonly be found plastered on the bedroom walls of teenage girls around the world.\n\nHe went on to produce music as a solo artist, including the songs and \n\nPayne’s solo career was marred with controversy and personal struggles with sobriety in recent years.\n\nHe faced intense backlash last year after a guest appearance on YouTuber Logan Paul’s podcast  Impaulsive .\n\nPayne, while drinking whisky, spoke negatively about his experience in One Direction, said he and member Louis Tomlinson despised one another to the point of physical arguments and accused another bandmate of “throwing him up against a wall” ahead of a concert.\n\n😳 BEING A GLOBAL POPSTAR ISN’T EASY‼️  #liampayne   #onedirection   #loganpaul   #impaulsive   #podcast   #fyp \n\n  ♬ Kyoto Flow – Official Sound Studio  \n\n \n\nPayne later expressed regret over the interview and said in a 2023 YouTube video that he “ became someone he didn’t recognize anymore. ”\n\nHe said he was “angry at what was going on around me” and took out his frustrations on others. Payne said he’d since attended rehab and was nearly six months sober.\n\n“The rest of the boys really stuck by me when I needed them most, they kind of came to the rescue,” he said of his former band members. “Even Zayn, as well, which is why I did send him a little thank you online.

Todd Custance said at the time that as part of their homicide investigation into Singh’s death, police officers went to a home the following day on Mayfield Road in Caledon and spoke with “several people,” including a man and a woman.\n\n On Nov. 20 , that man and woman were killed in a shooting at a home in Caledon, Peel police said. A third person was also wounded in the shooting.\n\nBut the family was not involved in drug trafficking at all and was “completely innocent,” Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Marty Kearns told a news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday.\n\n“Our investigation has determined that these three victims were mistakenly targeted,” Kearns said, referring to the murdered couple and their adult daughter, who was seriously injured in the shooting.\n\nAmerican officials say their investigation, dubbed Project Slalom, alleges Wedding and Clark ordered the deaths of the family members in Caledon in connection with a stolen drug shipment that had passed through Caledon.\n\nThe pair were also said to have ordered another hit on May 18 over a drug debt, although a release did not specify a location for that one. Peel police say the victim was a 39-year-old man from Brampton.\n\nThe D.O.J. also says Clark and a 23-year-old Canadian named Malik Damion Cunningham are also facing murder charges in connection with the killing of a 29-year-old man in Niagara Falls on April 1.\n\nThursday’s announcement said the pair were among 16 people who have been charged in Los Angeles in connection with a cocaine smuggling ring that was bringing 60 tonnes of cocaine a year from Colombia up through Mexico and into California before it was distributed across Canada and the U.S.\n\nAccording to RCMP, there were 10 Canadians among the 16 people who were charged in connection with Project Slalom. Eight have been arrested across North America, while Wedding and another man remain outstanding.\n\nThe FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and extradition of Wedding.\n\nThey allege that two men from Ontario, Hardeep Ratte, 45, and Gurpreet Singh, 30,  were behind a Canada-based transportation network that was shipping cocaine to Canada using long-haul semi-trucks.\n\nWedding, who is originally from Thunder Bay, competed for Canada in 2002 at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games in the men’s parallel giant slalom event.\n\nThe D.O.J. said he is the lead defendant in their case and currently resides in Mexico, where his known aliases include “El Jefe,” “Giant” and “Public Enemy.”\n\nHe is wanted on a number of charges, including conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to export cocaine, leading a continuing criminal enterprise, murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crime, and attempt to commit murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crime.\n\nWedding faces separate drug trafficking charges in Canada that date back to 2015, said Chris Leather, chief superintendent with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\n“Those charges are very much unresolved,” Leather said.\n\nWedding previously was convicted in the U.S. of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to prison in 2010, federal records show. Estrada said U.S. authorities believe that after Wedding’s release, he resumed drug trafficking and has been protected by the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico.\n\nClark, who was arrested in Mexico on Oct. 8, is facing the same charges as Wedding. He is said to also be known in Mexico as “The Dictator.”\n\nThe D.O.J. said police seized one tonne of cocaine, three firearms, dozens of rounds of ammunition, US$255,400 and more than $3.2 million in cryptocurrency as part of the investigation.\n\nThe D.O.J. indictment alleges that the 293 kilograms (646 pounds) of cocaine was shipped to Canada through the network and officers interrupted another shipment of 375.1 kilograms (827 pounds) headed north of the border as well.\n\n\n\n"},

He called 911 to report the death.\n\nHowever, when police and agents with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks arrived at the site, they couldn’t find any evidence of bear activity — rather, they believe Kjersem was the victim of a “brutal attack.”\n\nCapt.

{"title": "Ottawa’s mortgage changes will be a ‘double-edged sword,’ TD economist warns", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOttawa's proposed mortgage changes may help affordability in the short term, but there are risks to the stability of the Canadian financial system, one economist warns.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10816527/canada-mortgage-rule-changes-risks/", "article": "Ottawa’s proposed mortgage changes may well give first-time homebuyers a near-term boost in affordability, but could also stoke vulnerabilities in the Canadian economy, a TD Bank economist argues.\n\nRishi Sondhi  penned an analysis  of the Liberal government’s plans to  expand the availability of 30-year amortizations  to all first-time homebuyers and on all new builds, as well as to raise the price cap for insured mortgages to $1.5 million, up from $1 million today. Both changes are set to come into effect on Dec. 15.\n\nLonger amortizations help would-be buyers qualify for larger mortgages by reducing the monthly carrying costs of the loan.\n\nFor the typical homebuyer, Sondhi estimates the expanded 30-year amortizations will lead to an increase in purchasing power of around nine per cent.\n\nSondhi projects that the pair of moves aimed at loosening mortgage conditions in Canada will help stimulate homebuying in the first half of 2025. He expects that both sales and home prices will be two to four percentage points higher by the end of 2026, were it not for Ottawa’s mortgage changes.\n\nBut Sondhi told Global News in an interview Thursday that, thanks to rising prices tied to the policy itself, the initial bump in affordability tied to longer amortizations will be “completely eroded” in the next two years.\n\n“It’s a bit of a double-edged sword there,” he said. “They do get that near-term boost to activity. But at the same time, affordability is worse than it would have been absent these policies, which then limits the impact.”\n\nRaising the insured mortgage cap to $1.5 million will allow for more Canadians to access more expensive homes without having to put 20 per cent down upfront. Putting down less than that amount for a home allows a buyer to qualify for an insured product, but is also considered a higher loan-to-value mortgage.\n\nSondhi’s report estimates that roughly one in five homes in Canada are currently valued between $1 million and $1.5 million.\n\nThe biggest impact from the higher insured mortgage cap will likely be felt in Toronto and Vancouver, according to the TD Bank analysis, where the bulk of the homes in that price range can be found.\n\nFinance Minister  Chrystia Freeland has defended the Liberal proposals  as intentionally giving first-time homebuyers a “leg up” in the housing market.\n\nBut for a policy looking to stimulate ownership among first-time homebuyers, Sondhi wrote that the proposals “miss the mark.”\n\nCanadians looking to break into the housing market for the first time rarely have the levels of income needed to qualify for such sizable mortgages, Sondhi explained. A household looking to buy a property worth $1.45 million would need more than $225,000 in annual income to qualify for the mortgage, he calculated.\n\nThat’s “a stretch for many households, let alone first-time buyers,” Sondhi said.\n\nPolicies that will result in more high loan-to-value mortgages can also add some “fragility” to the Canadian financial system, Sondhi argued in his report.\n\nHe cites Bank of Canada research that shows higher loan-to-value ratios make homeowners more prone to defaulting on their mortgages.\n\nLonger amortization periods also affect Canadians’ abilities to absorb sudden financial shocks, Sondhi says. Whereas those with 25 years or less remaining on their mortgages can lengthen those amortizations as a way to mitigate rising rates, starting from 30 years limits a household’s ability to extend the payback period and cut down on monthly costs.\n\nCanada already has a highly indebted society, Sondhi noted, and these polices could see debt levels rise.\n\nMeasures that encourage more Canadians to take on higher-risk loans could intensify the risks to the financial system if a downturn were to hit the economy and household incomes take a hit, he said.\n\n“They are factors that can amplify a recession,” he said. “It definitely raises the vulnerability in the financial system, but sort of the broader economy as well.”\n\n"},

Council was able to take over the person’s cellphone number and get access codes to the SEC’s X account, which he shared with others who broke into the account and sent the post, the Justice Department says.\n\nProsecutors say after Council returned the iPhone he used for the SIM swap, his online searches included: “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them.”\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent Thursday to an attorney for Council, who is charged in Washington’s federal court with conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.\n\nThe price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to just below $48,000 after the unauthorized post hit on Jan. 9 and then dropped to around $45,200 after the SEC’s denial.  The SEC officially approved  the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin the following day.\n\n"},

He stated the province is taking all measures to improve access and streamline front-line care, but did not clarify whether the proposed plan was entirely off the table.\n\n“Quebecers who have a family doctor will keep them. We want to reassure the population. Just as we committed to in our Health plan, our goal is clear: we are taking all measures to facilitate access and simplify the organization of front-line care, and this, for all Quebecers,” he said in French.\n\n“Now, let’s let the negotiations run their course.”\n\nDéclaration (17/10/2024)👇🏼  pic.twitter.com/aruPII6JWC \n\n— Christian Dubé (@cdube_sante)  October 17, 2024 \n\n\n\nIn a  report released Oct. 9 , the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS), commissioned by Quebec’s Ministry of Health and Social Services, examined a number of scenarios aimed at addressing the family doctor crisis in Quebec.\n\nThe report suggests one approach to addressing the family doctor crisis is where healthy Quebecers would lose their registration with a family doctor. This change would free up 1.5 million appointment slots, which would then be reallocated to serve vulnerable patients, it stated.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Social Services also previously said the idea remained just a proposal and lacked any concrete plans at this stage.\n\nRapport de l’INESSS sur les clientèles vulnérables (10/10/2024) 👇🏼\n\nIl est beaucoup trop tôt pour s’avancer sur un quelconque scénario proposé par des experts. \n\nNous sommes en période de négociation et nous ne ferons aucun autre commentaire.  https://t.co/e2LIyxmy7p \n\n— Christian Dubé (@cdube_sante)  October 10, 2024 \n\n\n\nDespite the lack of legs of this proposal, Dr. Marion Dove, a family physician and associate professor of family medicine at McGill University in Montreal, has called this idea dangerous and poorly conceived, warning that it could result in worse patient care and increased physician burnout.\n\n“It’s very problematic. Every Canadian should have the right to have a family doctor or primary care practitioner, and they should have this person to whom they can turn when they have a health problem of any type,” she told Global News.\n\n“This idea of kind of separating people into categories based on their illness and matching them with the health-care provider based on what illness they have is removing the whole relationship aspect from health care, which is fundamentally wrong and is going to be detrimental to our entire system, to patients and to health-care workers and to the cost of the whole system,” she added.\n\nDove, a family medicine practitioner with 30 years of experience, reviewed the report and observed that none of its authors were family doctors. Not only is she concerned about the outcomes of this proposal but she also mentioned that one of her patients has already expressed worry about possibly losing her as their doctor.\n\nBefore Dubé’s X post on Thursday assuring Quebecers that they would keep their family doctors, he remarked in French during Quebec’s National Assembly on Oct. 11 that it was far too early to advance any proposals from the report.\n\nOpposition parties had demanded clear answers for the millions of Quebecers who could potentially lose their family doctors under the proposal.\n\n“The Coalition Avenir Québec does not have the mandate to unsubscribe millions of Quebecers who already have a family doctor and who, today, find themselves with the prospect of losing this follow-up, losing this access and continuing to pay for a system that does not provide basic services to the population,” denounced Joël Arseneau, a Parti Quebecois Member of the National Assembly, in an interview with The Canadian Press Friday morning.\n\n“Christian Dubé must absolutely clarify his position,” demanded Liberal MNA André Fortin in a telephone interview. “Is this a trial balloon or is this really the scenario he is considering today? He’s going to have to make decisions.”\n\nIn an email to Global News on Wednesday, the Federation of General Practitioners of Quebec said it would be “precocious” to confirm whether or not this is a good or bad option.\n\n“It’s one expert scenario among many that we’re exploring with Quebec’s family doctors, who want to care for as many patients as possible, as efficiently as possible,” the spokesperson said.\n\n“Of course, we have to prioritize the most vulnerable patients. But vulnerability is an evolving part of a person’s life. It’s not just linked to a diagnosis. We’re really open to different options, different avenues, really, but access must not be compromised by administrative categorizations of patients.”\n\nGlobal News asked Canada’s Health Minister Mark Holland about the proposal, and he responded in an email Thursday, stating that the provinces and territories are primarily responsible for delivering health-care services.\n\n“We are reviewing the report and will continue working with provinces and territories to ensure that all Canadians have access to the care they need,” he said.\n\nIn recent years, incentives have been implemented to help family doctors improve access for people not registered with a family doctor. However, due to an aging population and a significant number of family doctor retirements, meeting the needs of the entire population has become challenging, the report states.\n\nThe report proposes dividing Quebecers into different health categories:\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, one in four Quebecers, or around 2.1 million people, did not have a family doctor, and around 500,000 of these individuals had major or moderate health problems, according to the report.\n\nThe report also noted that healthy individuals, who account for 57 per cent of the population, make up 40 per cent of doctor visits, often for minor acute illnesses.\n\nOn average, people registered with a family doctor consult between two and six times more clinics than those not registered, depending on their health profile.\n\nPeople who are not registered with a family doctor consult emergency departments more often, particularly for non-urgent problems.\n\nThe study presents a scenario in which 1.5 million appointments allocated to people who have a family doctor would be transferred instead to people who do not have a family doctor.\n\nHealthy people registered with a doctor would lose 640,000 appointments and those not registered would gain 780,000.\n\nThe second category, among people with minor chronic conditions, who account for 1.4 million visits: registered people would lose 170,000 appointments and non-registered people would gain 90,000.\n\nThe third category is people with moderate conditions, who account for 5.5 million visits. Those registered would lose 570,000 visits, and those not registered would gain 340,000.\n\nFinally, for patients dealing with major illnesses: registered people would lose 140,000 appointments, while non-registered people would gain 330,000.\n\nIn all, the redistribution of appointments from registrants to non-registrants would total 1.5 million.\n\nDove acknowledges the shortage of family physicians in Quebec, but she believes there are more effective solutions than simply reallocating doctors to patients they do not know.\n\n“I have patients that I’ve taken care of through different illnesses, through cancer, through diabetes, through chronic illness, like hypertension. And when they come to see me, it is so much easier for me to take care of them that they don’t have to start at zero each time … you know their health priorities,” she explained.\n\n“You get to know people over time, and this improves the quality of care that you can give to people, improves their satisfaction, and improves the efficacy of the care that you’re giving.”\n\nHowever, she is concerned that being assigned a large number of unfamiliar patients would increase her workload and lead to decreased patient satisfaction.\n\nShe also worries that removing a patient’s family doctor could negatively impact their health.\n\nMany patients have developed strong relationships with their family doctors, which contribute to their well-being. If healthy patients are taken away from their doctors simply because they are considered “too healthy,” they may become sick.\n\nThis reflects a misunderstanding of cause and effect, she says.\n\n“It seems kind of like a bureaucratic answer to this problem, to say, ‘OK, if we have resource X and we have we best match it with patient Y.’ But they’re not taking the human and the relational component into account, this is not the solution,” she said.\n\nOne way she believes doctors could take on more patients is by reducing the administrative burden on family physicians.\n\nGrowing administrative burdens are leading to a shortage of family physicians, not just in Quebec, but also the provinces like Ontario,  according to the Ontario College of Family Physicians .\n\nFamily doctors who soon plan to leave the profession report that they are overwhelmed with administrative work, the college said. They report spending an average of 19.1 hours per week on administrative tasks such as filling out forms, the college added.\n\n“Some of the solutions that people have been proposing are to increase the administrative support for family doctors. You spend an awful lot of time looking for forms, faxing and trying to find ways to refer people,” Dove said.\n\n“If they change the system to facilitate the work of family doctors then we could see way more patients.”\n\n\n\n"},

Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel.\n\nIsrael has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority.\n\nHamas has not yet commented directly on the Israeli announcement, but photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be Sinwar half-buried in rubble with a gaping wound in his head.\n\nA statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad Friday seemed to be a reference to Sinwar’s death and said Israel is mistaken if it “believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.”\n\nHamas political bureau member Bassem Naim, who is usually based in Qatar, said that past leaders in the organization had also been killed and “Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.”\n\nHe added that it is “painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders” but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be “eventually victorious.”\n\nWhen asked if the statement was a confirmation of Sinwar’s death, however, Naim said it was not.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that “our war is not yet ended.” But many, from the governments of Israel’s allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war.\n\nIran’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006.\n\n“When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,” the statement said. “However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.”\n\nMore than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran.\n\nIn Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days.\n\nThe statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday night, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens.\n\nThe group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters were working according to “plans prepared in advance” to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced several missile and artillery attacks on Israeli forces operating in villages in southern Lebanon’s border area overnight and Friday morning.\n\nIn one case, the group said it fired a heavy missile barrage at Israeli soldiers who were trying to evacuate those wounded in an earlier strike. The group also said it had fired “large missile salvos” at a military barracks in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and at the Zvulun area north of Haifa.\n\nEarlier this week, Hezbollah’s acting leader Naim Kassem warned that the group will continue to target wider areas of Israel unless a cease-fire is implemented in Lebanon.\n\nAs Israel fought militants in Lebanon and in Gaza, its military said Friday that its forces had killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan.\n\nSuch infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The conflict has destroyed vast swathes of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people.\n\n\n\n"},

They said top Indian officials were then passing that information along to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder.\n\nThe two sides ordered the expulsion of top diplomats this week in the deepening crisis over the accusations, including Canada’s allegation that the diplomats were linked to the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nThe New York murder-for-hire plot was first disclosed by federal prosecutors last year when they announced charges against a man, Nikhil Gupta, who was recruited by a then-unidentified Indian government employee to orchestrate the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in New York.\n\nGupta was extradited to the United States in June from the Czech Republic after his arrest in Prague last year.\n\nIn a statement, the intended victim, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, said the indictment means the U.S. government has “reassured its commitment to fundamental constitutional duty to protect the life, liberty and freedom of expression of the U.S. Citizen at home and abroad.”\n\nHe added, “The attempt on my life on American Soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism which has become a challenge to America’s sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy, which unequivocally proves that India believes in using bullets while pro Khalistan Sikhs believe in ballots.”\n\nIndia’s government on Thursday denied it was working with mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada as alleged by Ottawa, and even suggested that Canadian authorities had been resisting India’s attempts to extradite those people to India.\n\nThe Nijjar killing in Canada has soured India-Canada ties for more than a year, and despite Canada’s assertion that it has forwarded evidence of its allegations to Indian authorities, the Indian government continues to deny it has seen any.\n\nJaiswal said again on Thursday that Canada has provided no evidence of its allegations surrounding attacks on Sikh activists, contradicting Trudeau’s statements this week that his country’s investigators have privately shared information with Indian counterparts and found them to be uncooperative.\n\nFour Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s murder and are awaiting trial.\n\nThe accusations have also tested Washington’s relations with India, often viewed by the West as a counterbalance to China.\n\nIndia has labeled Sikh separatists as “terrorists” and threats to its security. Sikh separatists demand an independent homeland known as Khalistan to be carved out of India. An insurgency in India during the 1980s and 1990s killed tens of thousands.\n\n\n\n"},

Safety is not something we can compromise on, ever,” said CN spokesman Jonathan Abecassis in an emailed statement.\n\nEven before the slowdowns at crossings, delays were not uncommon at Via Rail. Only 59 per cent of Via trains reached their destination on time last year, and 57 per cent the year before.\n\nLast year, more than 96 per cent of Via’s riders and more than four-fifths of its revenue stemmed from the stretch of track that runs between Quebec City and Windsor, including the Ottawa loop.\n\nAll 32 Venture trainsets that Via ordered from German manufacturing giant Siemens are poised to enter service along that corridor by the end of next summer, with older rolling stock to be phased out.\n\nThat means more and more passengers will experience delays — since the new restrictions apply only to Venture trains — unless Via can find a workaround.\n\n“We can’t just add more Venture cars,” Via said in an Oct. 11 notice sent to locomotive engineers and seen by The Canadian Press.\n\nOne solution may be a so-called shunt enhancer, which strengthens the reliability of track circuits used near crossings to detect an approaching train and trigger warning devices — lights, bells and gates.\n\n“Via is actively engaging with suppliers to evaluate and procure these devices,” the company said in the notice.\n\n"},

Johnston, one of the lawyers for the Quebec plaintiffs, said the proposal is “historic and unprecedented” because it allows for the compensation of smokers as well as governments.\n\n“When we took this case, there had never been a single plaintiff who had received a single penny from a tobacco company,” he said Thursday.\n\n“We took this case in 1998 and as a result of our case, not only will tens of thousands of victims be compensated by the tobacco industry in Canada, most of them in Quebec, but also governments are going to be sharing $24 billion.”\n\nThe plaintiffs have endured lengthy delays and now they can finally see that there’s “probably a light at the end of the tunnel and that they will receive compensation,” he said.\n\nWhile many of the class-action members died before they could receive any money from the companies, their successors — and in some cases, their successors’ successors — will be eligible for compensation, he said.\n\nThe proposed deal would also see the companies pour more than $1 billion into a foundation to fight tobacco-related diseases.\n\nThe proposal must still go through several steps before it can be put into action, including a vote by creditors and approval by the court.\n\nNegotiations between the companies and their creditors were confidential, and several health-care groups argued the lack of transparency surrounding the talks would benefit the companies at the expense of other stakeholders.\n\nAs recently as last month, three groups — Action on Smoking & Health, Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada and the Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control — said recent court filings suggested the provinces had agreed to a process that would give the companies veto power over the final deal.\n\nThe groups have consistently urged the provinces to impose regulations and smoking-reduction measures as part of a deal with the companies.\n\nThe Quebec lawsuits involved smokers who took up the habit between 1950 and 1998 and fell ill or were addicted. Heirs of such smokers were also party to the suits.\n\nCourt filings from last year suggest hundreds of the class-action members have died since the creditor protection proceedings began.\n\n"},

But one thing sets Andrew Goodsell apart and makes him uniquely positioned to comment on a central campaign issue: he is living rough in a tent in the city’s south end.\n\nGoodsell, who is 38, moved to Halifax from eastern Ontario about a decade ago. Having experienced homelessness at different periods of his life, Goodsell says he is running in Saturday’s election to offer voters an alternative to the career politicians who typically get elected.\n\n“I was like ‘Well, I’m not voting for these guys that are running right now. We don’t need more of the same. We need something different,’ so I picked up my phone and called city hall,” Goodsell said in an interview at a picnic table Wednesday.\n\nHe said the process to be registered as a candidate was straightforward: all he had to do was gather at least five nomination signatures and pay a $200 fee. He appointed himself as his own official campaign agent and provided as his address an office of the province’s Department of Community Services.\n\nNot surprisingly, Goodsell’s election platform focuses largely on housing. His No. 1 pledge is to create what he calls “dignified public housing” to make sure Haligonians have a place to call their own in a city where the cost of living has shot up and homeless encampments have proliferated.\n\nOne of the leading contenders for the mayor’s job, former Liberal MP Andy Fillmore, has said he would stop the expansion of encampments and remove tents appearing in non-designated areas within 24 hours. Goodsell, who said he has been ordered out of non-designated areas with little notice, said more support needs to be in place.\n\n“It’s clear when you look at the costs, (it costs) more than twice as much to keep someone homeless as it does to house that individual,” Goodsell said. His other campaign pledges include prioritizing affordable transit and imposing stricter conditions on developers.\n\nThere are many signs of Goodsell in downtown Halifax, whether it be a tent he sometimes pitches near the old Halifax Memorial Library, a table where he can be seen folding origami or his “Andrew Goodsell for Mayor” slogan written in chalk on sidewalks, enclosed in a heart. Voters also have a good chance of bumping into him with his black Belgian shepherd Dusty in tow.\n\nGoodsell’s campaign includes weekly meet-ups outside the former library on Sundays. He has also printed a few hundred flyers to hand out, but as a candidate on a significantly tighter budget — he says he lives on income assistance that provides about $400 a month — Goodsell has relied largely on social media to spread his message.\n\nPolling puts Goodsell far behind Fillmore and current city councillors Waye Mason and Pam Lovelace in the race to be Halifax Regional Municipality mayor, but with about one per cent support he is still in the top half of the field.\n\nJeff Karabanow, a social work professor at Dalhousie University, said Goodsell’s candidacy helps break the myth that unhoused people don’t participate in civil society.\n\n“Here’s an individual who’s deeply engaged in the politics of the day …. It demonstrates the diversity of folks who are unhoused these days,” Karabanow said in an interview.\n\nTamara Stein, a housing advocate who works with unhoused people in Halifax, echoed Karabanow, saying Goodsell brings an important perspective to the campaign.\n\n“Nobody knows better what’s going on than somebody who lives it,” she said. “If you’re running for something and fighting for something you believe in, then it shouldn’t matter what your stature is.”\n\nAs election day approaches, Goodsell said he hopes his campaign has inspired people.\n\n“If I’m able to run and do this with zero support … hopefully I’m inspiring someone out there that’s got the capabilities more so than me to actually reach out to people,” he said.\n\nHe describes himself as simply “two feet and a heartbeat,” using sidewalk chalk to spread the word. “The amount of people I’ve been able to reach out to is a clear example that, if you are willing to put in the effort in, you’ll get the people behind you.”\n\n\n\n"},

Currently, only 43 WHO member states have any kind of front-of-package labeling either mandatory or voluntary, the UN agency told Reuters, despite evidence showing labels can affect buying behavior.\n\nThe WHO began work on the draft guidelines, which have not been previously reported, in 2019. They aim “to support consumers in making healthier food-related decisions,” Katrin Engelhardt, a scientist in the Nutrition and Food Safety department of the WHO, told Reuters by email.\n\nA public consultation on the guidelines closed on Oct. 11 and the finalized version will be released in early 2025.\n\nThe WHO’s guidance recommends governments implement “interpretive” labels that include nutritional information and some explanation of what that means about the healthiness of a product.\n\nAn example would be NutriScore, developed in France and used in a number of European countries, which ranks food from A (green, containing essential nutrients) to E (red, containing high levels of added salts, sugars, fats or calories).\n\nChile and several other countries in Latin America use a tougher system, with warnings that a food is “high in sugar,” salt or fat on the front of the package, in a black octagon that resembles a stop sign. Food labeling expert Lindsey Smith Taillie, co-director of the Global Food Research Program at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said the food industry has pushed back against warnings and favors “non-interpretive” labels, which include the nutrient information but no guide on how to understand what that means, such as those used in the United States.\n\nThis week, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders announced plans for a Senate hearing on tougher food labeling in December. While the WHO recommendation goes a step further than the industry’s preference, it “is fairly weak,” Taillie said.\n\n“The most important thing for most countries globally is going to be to limit excess intake of added sugars, sodium, saturated fat and ultra-processed foods more generally – which is what warning labels do best.”\n\nResearch this summer by Taillie showed Chile’s warning labels, alongside other policies like marketing restrictions to children, meant Chileans bought 37% less sugar, 22% less sodium, 16% less saturated fat and 23% fewer total calories compared to if the law had not been implemented.\n\nThe WHO said there was not enough evidence to determine the best label system.\n\nThe International Food and Beverage Alliance, whose members include The Coca Cola Company and Mondelez International Inc, said that its members already have minimum worldwide standards globally. They include listing nutrients on the back of packages, plus a front of pack detail on at least the energy content where practicable, in line with the international Codex Alimentarius system.\n\n“This is something global companies can do, but it’s clearly not enough because if you take Nigeria or Pakistan … the market is dominated by local producers,” said Rocco Renaldi, the IFBA’s Secretary-General. He said the alliance’s members broadly support the WHO’s guidelines and nutrient-based labels.\n\n“But the devil is in the detail – generally speaking, we don’t support approaches that demonize particular products,” he said. “We don’t think health-warning type labels belong on food products that are deemed safe, approved and on the market, and loved by consumers.”\n\n\n\n"},

When a catastrophic force from thousands of years ago rises to threaten humanity, it also forces the seven wealthy politicians into the woods to fend for themselves.\n\nCo-directed by Maddin, Galen Johnson and Evan Johnson (who also wrote the screenplay), takes its audience on an absurd, witty and melodramatic journey.\n\nLike all of Maddin’s earlier works, the film finds a precise balance between campy comedy and dramatic commentary.\n\nOscar winner Cate Blanchett leads the movie’s ensemble cast with an exceptional performance as the fictional chancellor of Germany, Hilda Orlmann. Naturally, British actor Charles Dance is the toughened American president, complete with an English accent.\n\nTo his credit, Canadian actor Roy Dupuis is a true scene-stealer in portraying a passionate, dramatic — and occasionally weepy — prime minister.

Canada that led to the expulsion of diplomats. \t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10817977/canada-india-foreign-interference-allegations-probe/", "article": "A parliamentary committee will probe  new allegations of Indian foreign interference in Canada  that led to the expulsion of diplomats by both countries in tat-for-tat-moves.\n\nAt an emergency meeting on Friday, MPs on the standing committee on public safety and national security agreed to undertake a study concerning the “electoral interference and violent criminal activities carried out by agents the Government of India.”\n\nThis came after new revelations from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which said on Monday that it has significant information on criminal activity allegedly orchestrated by  agents of the Indian government. \n\nThe evidence points to “violent extremism” in both countries, links tying Indian government agents to homicides and violent acts, use of organized crime targeting the South Asian community in Canada, and interference in democratic processes,  according to the RCMP. \n\nNDP MP Alistair MacGregor moved the motion to start the probe, which was agreed after amendments in a vote by all members on the committee.\n\n“For the RCMP, indeed, for any police force that is conducting an active investigation to come out with such explosive revelations, I think underscores just how serious this is,” MacGregor said on Friday.\n\nAs part of this study, it was agreed that at least six meetings will be held.\n\nThe committee will invite senior officials like Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme, National Security and Intelligence Advisor Nathalie Drouin.\n\nThe Conservatives said they would also like to hear from incoming CSIS director Daniel Rogers, as well as Shawn Tupper, the deputy minister of Public Safety Canada and the deputy minister of Global Affairs Canada, David Morrison.\n\nOther witnesses include experts from Canada’s South Asian community, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, any former leadership candidates of the 2022 Conservative Party leadership race and national security subject matter experts.\n\nAn additional category of witnesses will also testify on the impact of the disinformation campaign by India, the committee agreed.\n\nRelations between India and Canada have soured since 2023 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadian intelligence agencies had credible evidence linking agents of the Indian government to the assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C.\n\nIndia has long denied any involvement in Nijjar’s killing and accused Trudeau on Monday of pursuing a “political agenda.”\n\nGlobal News has learned agents working out of India’s high commission in Ottawa and consulates in Vancouver and Toronto were behind dozens of violent crimes across Canada that targeted opponents of the Narendra Modi government.\n\nAccording to senior sources familiar with the matter, supporters of the  Khalistan  movement, which seeks independence for India’s Sikh-majority Punjab region, as well as rivals of the Modi government, were targeted.\n\nNDP’s MacGregor also put forward a second motion on Friday calling on all federal party leaders to apply for the “appropriate security clearance level in the next 30 days in order to review classified information and take necessary actions to protect Canadians.”\n\nTrudeau suggested Wednesday that Canadian intelligence agencies have information that  multiple Conservative politicians are “engaged or at risk”  from foreign interference schemes.\n\nTrudeau noted that list of names include Liberal politicians as well as those from “other parties,” without expanding on what the parliamentarians were suspected of doing.\n\nThe second motion got pushback from Conservative MPs on Friday who instead pressed for the release of names of all parliamentarians who are alleged to have interfered with and knowingly colluded with foreign powers.\n\n“These names have to have to come out … and there’s only one person who can do that, and that’s the prime minister of Canada,” said Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman.\n\n“Canadians deserve to know which members of Parliament in which party, no matter what, are colluding with foreign governments, wittingly or unwittingly.”\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May argued that releasing such names would “break the law” and could place Canadian intelligence assets “at risk.”\n\nMaking names public poses “a threat to Canadian security and can actually jeopardize lives,” May said.\n\nMacGregor proposed that any release of names should ensure that it protects national security and those who gathered the intelligence.\n\nThe committee will reconvene next week on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n"},

Managing the overlooked life stage", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMany millennials may unknowingly be experiencing the early signs of perimenopause, a transitional phase to menopause that can start in their late 30s.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10815765/perimenopause-symptoms-millennials/", "article": "Waking up drenched in sweat, having irregular periods and forgetting your friend’s name mid-conversation — sound familiar? For many  millennials , these aren’t just signs of a hectic life, but the early symptoms of  perimenopause .\n\nPerimenopause, the transition leading up to menopause, can start as early as the late 30s and last up to 10 years. Yet many people remain unaware they’re experiencing the symptoms, often attributing them to stress, a busy lifestyle or simply aging.\n\nMillennials, born between 1981 and 1996, may not think they’re old enough for menopause symptoms, but many are already at an age where early signs of perimenopause can appear.\n\n“I call it ‘millenialpause,'” said Dr. Judith Joseph, a medical doctor and board-certified psychiatrist based in New York City, speaking to Global News ahead of World Menopause Day taking place on Friday.\n\nJoseph, who is a millennial herself, explained this generation has much more information at their fingertips about perimenopause and menopause than those before them, leading to help destigmatize the topic and fostering open conversations.\n\n“We are the age of information, so we want to learn about things. We don’t trust people to rescue us,” she said. “That’s why I think we’re set up for a better outcome than earlier generations because we just have so much information and we have a culture of curiosity.”\n\nAlthough she believes millennials will be more open to discussing the symptoms and impacts of perimenopause, Joseph still sees it as a largely underdiagnosed stage of life.\n\nMenopause is officially diagnosed after a person has gone a full year without a period, usually occurring around the average age of 51, according to the  Menopause Foundation of Canada . Yet, the journey to that milestone — referred to as perimenopause — brings unexpected emotional and physical challenges that many people may not anticipate.\n\nDuring this phase, estrogen levels begin to drop, ovulation begins to wind down and menstrual periods become irregular, the Menopause Foundation of Canada stated.\n\nAnd it’s different than the hormonal changes people feel during their periods, Joseph said.\n\n“You’re going to experience hormonal fluctuations of estrogen and progesterone that are way more intense and way more wide and unpredictable compared to, let’s say, your menstrual period,” she explained.\n\n“It’s different because leading up to that point where you have your final period and you’re no longer ovulating, those fluctuations are much more intense and they can lead to the symptoms of perimenopause.”\n\nTracy Gomes, 54, had always experienced irregular and heavy periods. In her 40s, when the bleeding worsened, the Toronto resident consulted her doctor, who told her she had amenia caused by iron deficiency from excessive blood loss.\n\nBut she and her doctor did not know what was causing the heavy blood loss.\n\n“I thought it was fibroids and that’s what I was going back and forth to my doctor about. So I had ultrasounds and all of these tests to see what it was, and I also saw an oncologist for a while,” she told Global News.\n\nHowever, the heavy periods persisted. It wasn’t until Gomes reached her 50s and entered menopause that she realized her previous symptoms, including the heavy bleeding, had been clear signs of perimenopause.\n\n“I went to the Menopause Foundation of Canada website and they had a page on symptoms of menopause and symptoms of perimenopause,” she said, adding that once she read that heavy periods were a symptom she realized that’s what she was experiencing.\n\nShe was happy she finally found her answer but still upset that her doctor and all the specialists were never able to identify the underlying cause of her symptoms earlier.\n\nThis is not uncommon, Joseph explained, as many doctors may be unfamiliar with perimenopause and often attribute the symptoms to other conditions, such as burnout, depression or autoimmune diseases.\n\n“When I was in medical school, I didn’t know…. I thought about menopause as happening when you’re 50. No one told us about perimenopause. This is a relatively new thing for so many health-care professionals,” she said.\n\n Symptoms of perimenopause  can vary but often include:\n\nIt’s important to keep track of these symptoms and discuss them with your health-care provider, Joseph advised, to avoid being misdiagnosed and placed on unnecessary medication.\n\nSeveral factors can cause some women to show signs of perimenopause earlier than others, Joseph explained.\n\nThese factors may include genetics, lifestyle choices such as smoking, diet and exercise, as well as certain medical conditions or treatments, like autoimmune diseases.\n\nRace and ethnicity can also play a role.\n\n“Depending on race and background and genetics, Black women and Indigenous women tend to go through perimenopause and menopause earlier, longer and with more severe symptoms,” Joseph said.\n\nHealthy eating, getting enough sleep, regular exercise — such as strength training, limiting alcohol and avoiding smoking are crucial not only for preventing perimenopausal symptoms but also for relieving discomfort, Joseph said.\n\n“Now I really limit alcohol, I’m eating tons of protein and in terms of working out, I’m lifting weights,” she said.\n\n“When you’re eating foods that are not processed or sugary, that decreases inflammation in your body. And decreasing inflammation helps with joint pain, it helps with brain fog, it helps with sleep. These lifestyle hacks are really important.”\n\nShe also mentioned that other, more natural, effective methods for managing symptoms include meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nThere are also hormonal specialists to consult with about whether medication could be a good fit for you, Joseph said.\n\nThis includes hormone therapy using estrogen or estrogen and progestins to level out hormones and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs),  according to Johns Hopkins Medicine .\n\n“It depends because when you see a hormone specialist, they may say hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills,” Joseph said, adding that because of all the different treatment options, it’s important to have someone know you and understand your unique biochemistry so they can provide the best treatment.\n\n"},

The group was moving 60 tonnes of cocaine a year through Mexico and into Southern California before it was distributed into Canada and throughout the U.S.\n\nWedding and another Canadian, Andrew Clark, were also said to have ordered several hits in Ontario, one of which resulted in the deaths of a couple from Caledon. Police said the two victims were innocent and it was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nThe DOJ said he currently resides in Mexico, where his known aliases include “El Jefe,” “Giant” and “Public Enemy.”\n\nWhile Clark, who is known as ‘The Dictator’ in Mexico, has been arrested in that country, Wedding remains on the run.\n\nThe FBI has offered a US$50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and extradition to the United States.\n\n"},

An autopsy report released Thursday revealed Payne died of multiple serious injuries and “ internal and external bleeding ” as a result of the balcony fall.\n\nThe surviving One Direction bandmates —  Harry Styles ,  Louis Tomlinson ,  Niall Horan  and  Zayn Malik  — first published a joint statement to social media late Thursday afternoon.\n\n“We’re completely devastated by the news of Liam’s passing,” the  band wrote on Instagram . “In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly.”\n\nThe former boy banders said they would treasure their memories with Payne forever, and sent well wishes to his family, friends and their fans.\n\n“We love you Liam,” the bandmates signed off.\n\nAfter the release of One Direction’s joint statement, the bandmates slowly shared individual tributes to Payne on their social media accounts.\n\nFirst to post was Tomlinson, who called Payne a role model and “ a positive, funny, and kind soul .”\n\n\n\n A post shared by Louis Tomlinson (@louist91) \n\n\n\n“I first met Liam when he was 16 and I was 18, I was instantly amazed by his voice but more importantly as time went on I got a chance to see the kind brother I’d longed all my life for,” Tomlinson, 32, wrote. “Liam was an incredible song writer with a great sense of melody, we often spoke of getting back in the studio together to try and recreate the writing chemistry we had built up in the band.”\n\nTomlinson called Payne “the most vital part of One Direction” and thanked him for shaping the band.\n\nThe singer then extended a personal message to Payne, “if you’re listening.”\n\nTomlinson said he is “beyond lucky” to have had Payne in his life but is “really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye.”\n\n“Reminiscing about all the thousands of amazing memories we had together is a luxury I thought I’d have with you for life,” he continued. “I would have loved to share the stage with you again but it wasn’t to be.”\n\nPayne and Tomlinson have both admitted to having an occasionally tense relationship while they were members of One Direction. During an infamous interview on Logan Paul’s podcast  Impaulsive , Payne in 2022 said he and Tomlinson despised one another to the point of physical arguments.\n\nThough Payne’s  interview was not well-received by One Direction fans,  Tomlinson later defended his bandmate  and said the podcast hosts were “disrespectful” and took advantage of Payne, who had relapsed on his sobriety.\n\nTomlinson said he and Payne became closer friends after One Direction announced its hiatus in 2015.\n\nMalik said he’s been “talking out loud” to Payne since news of his death.\n\n“I can’t help but think selfishly that there are so many more conversations for us to have in our lives.” Malik, 31, wrote. “I never got to thank you for supporting me through some of the most difficult times in my life.”\n\n“When I was missing home as a 17 year old kid you would always be there with a positive outlook and reassuring smile and let me know that you were my friend and that I loved,” he remembered.\n\n\n\n A post shared by Zayn Malik (@zayn) \n\n\n\nMalik said he admired Payne, despite the fact that they “butted heads” often in their youth.\n\n“I always secretly respected you for it,” Malik revealed of their arguments.\n\nThe singer said Payne was always the most “qualified” musician and member of One Direction.\n\n“I lost a brother when you left us and can’t explain to you what I’d give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly,” Malik concluded. “I will cherish all the memories I have with you in my heart forever, there is no words that justify or explain how I feel right now other than beyond devastated.”\n\nMalik suddenly left One Direction in 2015, and the band members continued for several months without him before announcing their hiatus.\n\nHe and Payne had a tumultuous relationship, which Payne spoke about — and later apologized for — on the  podcast.\n\nEarlier this year,  Malik said he was grateful  to be a part of One Direction, but wished he had “enjoyed” the experience more in his younger years.\n\n“I’m grateful that I’m able to be happier now,” Zayn said in an interview.\n\nStyles shared a short statement about Payne to Instagram on Thursday and said he is “truly devastated” by his bandmate’s death.\n\n“His greatest joy was making other people happy, and it was an honour to be alongside him as he did it,” Styles, 30, wrote. “Liam lived wide open, with his heart on his sleeve, he had an energy for life that was infectious.”\n\n\n\n A post shared by @harrystyles \n\n\n\n“He was warm, supportive, and incredibly loving,” Styles said of Payne. “The years we spent together will forever remain among the most cherished years of my life.”\n\nStyles said his “heart breaks” for Payne’s family members, his son and “all those around the world who knew him and loved him, as I did.”\n\nStyles has often spoken positively about his experience in One Direction and has credited the band’s development for his solo success.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Zane Lowe, ahead of the release of his album Styles  reminisced about the One Direction years . He recalled the first time the bandmates’ photo together was published in a local newspaper, and how “happy” the then-teenagers were over the little success.\n\nThe last One Direction member to share a tribute to Payne was Horan, who was also the band member to meet Payne in person most recently.\n\n\n\n A post shared by Niall Horan (@niallhoran) \n\n\n\nTwo weeks ahead of his death,  Payne attended Horan’s stadium concert  in Argentina. Payne was seen dancing in a private box at the venue ahead of and during the show, then met with Horan afterward.\n\nIn a statement posted to social media Friday, Horan said he is “devastated by the passing of my amazing friend, Liam.”\n\nHoran, 31, said he feels “fortunate” to have seen Payne recently.\n\n“I sadly didn’t know that after saying goodbye and hugging him, I would be saying goodbye forever,” he wrote. “It’s heartbreaking.”\n\nHoran said Payne’s death “just doesn’t feel real.”\n\n“Liam had an energy for life and a passion for work that was infectious,” he continued. “He was the brightest in every room and always made everyone feel happy and secure.”\n\n“All the laughs we had over the years, sometimes about the simplest of things, keep coming to mind through the sadness,” Horan wrote. “We got to live out our wildest dreams together and I will cherish every moment we had forever. The bond and friendship we had doesn’t happen often in a lifetime.”\n\nNiall extended well wishes to Payne’s family and thanked his bandmate for “everything.”\n\nIn 2023, Horan said One Direction “ feels like it’s a separate life now .”\n\nHoran said he has “a good outlook on things, looking back” and was grateful he “didn’t lose the plot along the way.”\n\nThe members of One Direction met in 2010 on the U.K. singing competition when judges including Simon Cowell paired the then-teenage boys together in a group act.\n\nPayne had already auditioned for two years prior but was eliminated early on.

But others were simply rivals of the government, the sources said.\n\nThe revelations came as Canadian law enforcement continues to probe the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C., where the killers were allegedly linked to the Indian government.\n\nMaking the allegations public was an “extraordinary measure” by the RCMP, Joly said on Friday, adding that the alleged actions by India were something not seen before in Canadian history.\n\n“That level of transnational repression cannot happen on Canadian soil,” she said. “We’ve seen it elsewhere in Europe, Russia has done that in Germany and the U.K., but we needed to stand firm on this issue.”\n\n"},

{"title": "Can your standing desk raise health risks? A new study says you can go too far", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA new study says that using a standing desk at work promotes health, but it can be too much of a good thing. The trick is finding a balance between time spent sitting and standing.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10818490/standing-desk-health-risks-new-study/", "article": "The term “sitting is the new smoking” has been cautioning office-workers against being sedentary in recent years, but a new study suggests that some may be swinging too far in the other direction.\n\nStanding desks have risen in popularity, with the global market  valued  at USD $7.75 billion, but new research warns against relying too much on them.\n\nThe study, led by the University of Sydney and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, studied 83, 013 adults in the United Kingdom to assess daily time spent sitting and standing. The study found that being on your feet for more than two hours a day can cause problems such as varicose veins, but does little to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease that comes with prolonged sitting.\n\nDr. Patricia Doyle-Baker, from the faculty of kinesiology at the University of Calgary, said, “Anybody who stands for a long period of time in a very still position is going to have some issues associated with either muscular-skeletal system or they’ll have blood pooling in their legs and in their feet.”\n\nHowever, Doyle-Baker said that what the study points out is not that standing desks are inherently bad for your health, but that holding any position for prolonged periods of time can be bad — whether it’s sitting or standing.\n\nScott Lear, professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University, said, “It’s not just sitting. It’s sedentary behaviour that is problematic — not moving.”\n\nHe said, “It’s a different posture than sitting. But as this study showed, it comes also with its own risks for heart disease and other things like varicose veins.”\n\nDoyle-Baker said, “This article is not saying don’t necessarily not stand at your desk, but think about the prolonged amount of time standing at your desk.”\n\nLear said standing users should be wary of blood pooling in their feet or legs.\n\n“If it pools and it’s not moving, some of the blood cells can cleave together and create these little clots,” he said. “What happens when the blood moves up from our feet and our lower legs? It goes to our heart and passes through the inner chambers of the heart and then goes to our lungs. And so that little clot will keep going merrily along until it gets to a blood vessel that’s too narrow.”\n\nThis, he said, can cause a pulmonary embolism for some people.\n\nSo should you throw your standing desk away? Not quite. Sitting for prolonged periods is still quite bad for you.\n\n“Sitting for extended, continuous periods can increase your chances for diabetes, heart disease, some cancers and a whole bunch of other diseases,” Lear said.\n\nSo if, sitting and standing can both cause health issues, what solution is there for the health conscious office worker? The answer, some experts say, may lie in height-adjustable sit-and-stand desks.\n\nA 2020 paper published by the Centre of Research Expertise for the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders (CRE-MSD) at the University of Waterloo said sit-stand workstations can help alleviate pain issues for some users. People suffering from conditions such as herniated disks in their spines could benefit from sit-stand desks.\n\n“Sit-Stand workstations can be effective for some individuals in relieving musculoskeletal discomfort, in particular low back pain,” the paper said.\n\nThe paper recommends office users employ a 1:1 ratio, which means in an eight-hour work day, you should ideally be sitting for four hours and standing for four hours. But it depends on how you split your time.\n\nJack Callaghan, one of the co-authors of the University of Waterloo paper, said, “Our gold standard, if people can do it, is you shouldn’t sit longer than 30 minutes without doing something else. And you should never stand longer than 15 minutes continuously.”\n\nDoyle-Baker said some people could benefit from something called the “20-eight-two rule”.\n\n“You sit for 20 minutes, you stand for eight minutes and you move for two minutes,” she said.\n\nIf you don’t have a standing desk or a height-adjustable standing desk but don’t want to spend the money, Lear said there are things you could incorporate in your day to make sure your body is in movement every 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n“If you’re working at home, it could be going upstairs, doing the laundry or just walking around,” he said.\n\nIf you’re at the office, small things like taking regular breaks to the coffee machine or water cooler could help.\n\n“I like to encourage people setting their phone alarm or something, where after half an hour it goes off. You can have the watches that will buzz if you’re not moving around,” he said. “Our joints like movement and our joints get lubricated when they move.”\n\nCallaghan said the most sedentary hours often come not during work, but after work.\n\n“(Sometimes) it’s not what you’re doing at work. It’s what you’re doing outside work, whether you’re spending an hour in the car, spending four hours on the couch,” he said.\n\nCallaghan recommended ditching your car for active transportation, such as public transit or bicycles, every once in a while, if possible.\n\nFor your home office, Doyle-Baker said a sit-stand desk might be a good idea.\n\n“I think anyone can benefit from a sit-to-stand situation,” she said. “I think standing desks are here to stay.”\n\n"},

I don’t come today as the daughter of a felon, nor a victim of an abnormally abusive mother,” she said in her opening remarks, which she shared on Instagram.\n\n\n\n A post shared by Shari Franke (@sharilfranke) \n\n\n\n“I come today as a victim of family vlogging. My goal today is not to present any idea of a solution to this problem, but to shed light on the ethical and monetary issues that come from being a child influencer.”\n\n Ruby Franke was arrested  in August of last year, after her 12-year-old son escaped through the window of business partner Jodi Hildebrandt’s house and sought help from a neighbour, begging for food and water. When emergency responders found him, he was  injured, starved and had duct tape on his wrists and ankles  covering up wounds.\n\nFranke’s 10-year-old daughter was also found in a similar condition when police searched the home.\n\nIn February, Franke was handed  four one-to-15-year-long prison sentence s by a Utah district court. Hildebrandt received the exact same sentence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Shari Franke spoke from personal experience to share the negative impact family vlogging has had on her life. She began appearing in her mother’s videos, alongside her five other siblings, in 2015.\n\n“It is more than just filming your family life and putting it online,” she said. “It is a full-time job with employees, business credit cards, managers and marketing strategies.”\n\nShe noted that family vlogging is different from a normal, family-run business, as “all the children are employees,” and almost always the “stars” of their parents’ social media content.\n\n“There is no such thing as a moral or ethical family vlogger,” she said, adding that while she was often paid for her work, the money was usually in the form of a bribe.\n\n“…Going on vacation was expected to be payment enough because most kids don’t get to go on regular and expensive trips,” she continued, adding that “the child’s labour is actually what paid for the vacation or trip.”\n\nShe then went on to share some of her most traumatic experiences as a child influencer.\n\n“Some of our most popular videos were when my eyebrow was accidentally waxed off, and the whole world saw a crying teenager who just wanted to mourn in private,” she said.\n\n“Or the time I was violently ill, and got the leading role in the video for that day. My friends became scarce, because dates would be filmed and none of my friends wanted to be on camera.”\n\nShe added, “If I could go back and do it all again, I’d rather have an empty bank account now and not have my childhood plastered all over the internet. No amount of money I received has made what I’ve experienced worth it.”\n\n\n\n A post shared by Shari Franke (@sharilfranke) \n\n\n\nOnly two U.S. states have laws around financial protections for teens and children who are featured on social media. Last year, Illinois enacted legislation that “creates a private right of action for child influencers against their parents that featured them in videos and  did not properly compensate them ,” according to Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s website.\n\nMore recently, California Gov. Gavin Newsom  passed legislation  that mandates parents and guardians set aside in trust accounts a percentage of earnings earned by minors who are “featured in monetized online content.”\n\nShari Franke said Wednesday that her mother’s crimes aside, what she experienced as a child influencer is “not unique.”\n\n“Family vlogging ruined my innocence long before Ruby committed a crime. I promise you that my experiences are not unique, and are happening to child influencers all over Utah and the country. Let’s tackle this issue before it becomes a bigger crisis than it already is.”\n\nShe also announced her upcoming memoir, that promises to “cover the painful journey and experiences of growing up under intense public scrutiny.”\n\n\n\n A post shared by Shari Franke (@sharilfranke) \n\n\n\n hits shelves in January.\n\n"},

Schools, including universities, were shuttered through Sunday. Recreational and cultural activities, including night clubs, were also ordered closed.\n\nOfficials said in mid-afternoon they had begun taking steps to restore power but that the process would take time.\n\nVirtually all commerce in the capital Havana ground to a halt on Friday. Many residents sat sweating on doorsteps. Tourists hunkered down in frustration.\n\n“We went to a restaurant and they had no food because there was no power, now we are also without internet,” said Brazilian tourist Carlos Roberto Julio, who had recently arrived in Havana. “In two days, we have already had several problems.”\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Marrero late on Thursday blamed worsening blackouts during the past several weeks on a perfect storm well-known to most Cubans – deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand.\n\n“The fuel shortage is the biggest factor,” Marrero said in a televised message that was garbled by technical difficulties and delayed several hours.\n\n“The situation has worsened in recent days,” the prime minister said. “We must be fully transparent … we have been halting economic activities to ensure energy for the population.”\n\nStrong winds that began with Hurricane Milton last week has crippled the island’s ability to deliver scarce fuel from boats offshore to its power plants, officials said.\n\nCuba’s government also blames the U.S. trade embargo, as well as new sanctions under former President Donald Trump, for difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate its oil-fired plants.\n\n“The complex scenario is caused primarily by the intensification of the economic war and financial and energy persecution of the United States,” Diaz-Canel said on X on Thursday.\n\n“The United States is not to blame for today’s blackout on the island, or the overall energy situation in Cuba,” a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said.\n\nWhile demand for electricity has grown alongside Cuba’s private sector, fuel supply has evaporated.\n\nCuba’s largest oil supplier, Venezuela, has reduced shipments to the island to an average of 32,600 barrels per day in the first nine months of the year, about half of the 60,000 bpd sent in the same period of 2023, according to vessel-monitoring data and internal shipping documents from Venezuela’s state company PDVSA.\n\nPDVSA, whose refining infrastructure is also ailing, has this year tried to avoid a new wave of fuel scarcity at home, leaving smaller volumes available for export to allied countries like Cuba.\n\nRussia and Mexico, which in the past have sent fuel to Cuba, have also greatly reduced shipments to the island.\n\nThe shortfalls have left Cuba to fend for itself on the far costlier spot market at a time when its government is near-bankrupt.\n\nElectricity officials said they nonetheless expect power generation to improve in the coming days as the weather allows fuel from prior deliveries to be distributed around the Caribbean’s largest island.\n\n\n\n"},

The little girl, who doctors told the court was “ blue ” in complexion, was later pronounced dead at another hospital.\n\nDoctors suspected Curtis had been abused and diagnosed the girl with shaken baby syndrome.\n\nRoberson was sentenced to death for capital murder in 2003.\n\nSince then, Roberson’s lawyers and bipartisan supporters have tried to stop his execution. Advocates have long argued Curtis died of complications from pneumonia, which progressed into sepsis.\n\nRoberson’s execution was stayed via a temporary restraining order issued by a Travis County judge. The order will allow Roberson to testify in a new hearing at the state legislature next week, on Oct. 21.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Texas House of Representatives voted unanimously to issue a subpoena for Roberson to appear at the hearing, thereby stalling his execution. Representatives argued executing Roberson before he could offer subpoenaed testimony would violate the Legislature’s constitutional authority.\n\nSuch a method to halt an execution had never been tried before, AP reported.\n\nThe petition was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court also refused to halt the execution.\n\nBut on Thursday, the Texas Supreme Court weighed in with its order and granted the stay, ending a night of uncertainty.\n\nA total of 86 bipartisan lawmakers in Texas, among them dozens of lawyers and medical and scientific experts, publicly called for Roberson to be pardoned. His supporters argue Roberson’s conviction predates a proper medical understanding of shaken baby syndrome.\n\nAdditionally, Roberson’s lawyers have argued his 2018 autism diagnosis, which came over a decade after his daughter’s death, must be considered in the case.\n\nThe diagnosis adds context, Roberson’s lawyers argue, in part because doctors said Roberson showed little emotion over his daughter’s death, evoking suspicion. Autism, a neurodevelopmental condition, can often affect how a person communicates with others.\n\nShe said no court before yesterday had yet to recognize that Roberson’s “life was worth fighting for.”\n\n“He lives to fight another day and hopes that his experience can help improve the integrity of our criminal legal system,” the lawyer concluded. “Thank you to all who have supported Robert, an innocent man on Texas’s death row.”\n\nRoberson is supported by the Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal organization that works to exonerate wrongly convicted people through DNA testing and other legal means.\n\nTexas state representatives Joe Moody (Democrat) and Jeff Leach (Republican) said they are “deeply grateful to the Texas Supreme Court” for the decision to block Roberson’s execution.\n\n“For over 20 years, Robert Roberson has spent 23.5 hours of every single day in solitary confinement in a cell no bigger than the closets of most Texans, longing and striving to be heard,” the statement reads.\n\n“We look forward to welcoming Robert to the Texas Capitol, and along with 31 million Texans, finally giving him—and the truth—a chance to be heard.”\n\nStatement from Chairman Joe Moody and Chairman Jeff Leach  #txlege   #RobertRoberson   https://t.co/H9lIUEvyhN   pic.twitter.com/kSJ9uUjOMh \n\n— Jeff Leach (@leachfortexas)  October 18, 2024 \n\n\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson Amanda Hernandez said she spoke with Roberson after his execution was stayed.\n\n“He was shocked, to say the least,” she said. said. “He praised God and he thanked his supporters. And that’s pretty much what he had to say.”\n\nIt is rare for the Texas Supreme Court — the state’s highest civil court — to get involved in a criminal matter. But how the all-Republican court wound up stopping Roberson’s execution in the final hours underlined the extraordinary manoeuvres used by a bipartisan coalition of state House lawmakers who have come to his defence.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has the power to delay a prisoner’s capital punishment for 30 days, did not intervene and has not spoken publicly about the case.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, whose members are appointed by the governor, denied Roberson clemency in a 6-0 vote.\n\n\n\n"},

The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike late last month, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier this month.\n\nSinwar, the former lead of Hamas, died “confronting the occupation army until the last moment of his life,” said his Qatar-based deputy, Khalil al-Hayya, who represented Hamas during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations. Hamas will not return any of the hostages, al-Hayya said, “before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza.”\n\nHamas heralded Sinwar in a statement, calling him a hero for “not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.”\n\nThe statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwar’s apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone.\n\nSinwar was the chief architect of the Hamas raid on Israel last year that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Hamas-run health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.\n\nThe offensive has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people and has left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel.\n\nSinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the Gaza conflict even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country.\n\nHezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the current Israel-Hamas conflict began, displacing tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes in the country’s north. More than 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced by Israel’s aerial bombardment and ground offensive.\n\nIran, which also supports Hamas, hailed Sinwar Friday as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel.\n\n“We, and countless others around the world, salute his selfless struggle for liberation of the Palestinian people,” Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on the X social media platform. “Martyrs live forever, and the cause for liberation of Palestine from occupation is more alive than ever.”\n\nIsrael has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that “our war is not yet ended.”\n\nStill, the governments of Israel’s allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday Sinwar’s death provides “an extraordinary opportunity to achieve a lasting cease-fire” and suggested the U.S. could have a role in helping to stabilize Gaza in the future. “Hopefully countries in the region will step up there,” Austin said at a NATO meeting in Brussels.\n\nItaly’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, meeting with her counterpart in Lebanon, said European countries are working for a “sustainable cease-fire” in both that country and in Gaza. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said “a diplomatic solution should overcome” the fighting.\n\nBut a day after Biden labeled Sinwar’s death an “opportunity for a ‘day after’ in Gaza without Hamas in power,” he acknowledged the difficulty of forging a cease-fire there, saying it might be easier to negotiate a stop to the fighting in Lebanon.\n\n“It’s going to be harder in Gaza,” Biden told reporters Friday after meeting with European leaders in Berlin.\n\nA White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, said it was “too soon” to assess who Hamas “might anoint as Sinwar’s successor and what that individual may be willing to pursue.”\n\nIn Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar’s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead.\n\n“We are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,”\n\nRonen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. “Sinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive.”\n\nNetanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information.\n\nIsrael’s military said Friday it allowed 30 trucks of food, water, medical and other supplies into northern Gaza, as the country faces pressure from the U.S. to ramp up aid. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.N. that the aid arrived and was being distributed in the north.\n\nIn Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days.\n\nThe statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group announced earlier this week it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military said Friday it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry said six people were killed in the past 24 hours of fighting, bringing the death toll over the past year to 2,418, a quarter of whom were women and children.\n\nOn Friday Israel said its forces killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan. Such infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023.\n\n\n\n"},

Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.\n\nThe investigation’s impact on Tesla’s self-driving ambitions isn’t clear. NHTSA would have to approve any robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel, and it’s unlikely that would happen while the investigation is in progress. But if the company tries to deploy autonomous vehicles in its existing models, that likely would fall to state regulations. There are no federal regulations specifically focused on autonomous vehicles, although they must meet broader safety rules.\n\nNHTSA also said it would look into whether any other similar crashes involving “Full Self-Driving” have happened in low visibility conditions, and it will seek information from the company on whether any updates affected the system’s performance in those conditions.\n\n“In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Tesla’s assessment of their safety impact,” the documents said.\n\nTesla reported the four crashes to NHTSA under an order from the agency covering all automakers. An agency database says the pedestrian was killed in Rimrock, Arizona, in November of 2023 after being hit by a 2021 Tesla Model Y. Rimrock is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Phoenix.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety said in a statement that the crash happened just after 5 p.m. Nov. 27 on Interstate 17. Two vehicles collided on the freeway, blocking the left lane. A Toyota 4Runner stopped, and two people got out to help with traffic control. A red Tesla Model Y then hit the 4Runner and one of the people who exited from it. A 71-year-old woman from Mesa, Arizona, was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe collision happened because the sun was in the Tesla driver’s eyes, so the Tesla driver was not charged, said Raul Garcia, public information officer for the department.\n\nTesla has twice recalled “Full Self-Driving” under pressure from NHTSA, which in July sought information from law enforcement and the company after a Tesla using the system struck and killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.\n\nThe recalls were issued because the system was programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds and because the system disobeyed other traffic laws. Both problems were to be fixed with online software updates.\n\nCritics have said that Tesla’s system, which uses only cameras to spot hazards, doesn’t have proper sensors to be fully self driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or poor visibility conditions.\n\nMusk has said that humans drive with only eyesight, so cars should be able to drive with just cameras. He has called lidar (light detection and ranging), which uses lasers to detect objects, a “fool’s errand.”\n\nThe “Full Self-Driving” recalls arrived after a three-year investigation into Tesla’s less-sophisticated Autopilot system crashing into emergency and other vehicles parked on highways, many with warning lights flashing.\n\nThat investigation was closed last April after the agency pressured Tesla into recalling its vehicles to bolster a weak system that made sure drivers are paying attention. A few weeks after the recall, NHTSA began investigating whether the recall was working.\n\nNHTSA began its Autopilot crash investigation in 2021, after receiving 11 reports that Teslas that were using Autopilot struck parked emergency vehicles. In documents explaining why the investigation was ended, NHTSA said it ultimately found 467 crashes involving Autopilot resulting in 54 injuries and 14 deaths. Autopilot is a fancy version of cruise control, while “Full Self-Driving” has been billed by Musk as capable of driving without human intervention.\n\nThe investigation that was opened Thursday enters new territory for NHTSA, which previously had viewed Tesla’s systems as assisting drivers rather than driving themselves. With the new probe, the agency is focusing on the capabilities of “Full Self-Driving” rather than simply making sure drivers are paying attention.\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the previous investigation of Autopilot didn’t look at why the Teslas weren’t seeing and stopping for emergency vehicles.\n\n“Before they were kind of putting the onus on the driver rather than the car,” he said. “Here they’re saying these systems are not capable of appropriately detecting safety hazards whether the drivers are paying attention or not.”\n\n"},

But delaying that requirement preserved Apple’s exclusive control of a payment system that has generated commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on some e-commerce occurring within apps. Apple exhausted its avenue of appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nGoogle also pockets billions of dollars annually from a similar commission system within its Play Store for Android phones — a setup that is allowed to continue as long as Google can prevent Donato’s ruling from taking effect.\n\nIn its arguments for delaying Donato’s order, Google said it wasn’t being given enough time to make the drastic changes it framed as “a Herculean task creating an unacceptable risk of safety and security failures within the Android ecosystem.”\n\nGoogle also argued the shake-up would saddle it with unreasonable costs, a contention Donato also brushed aside during Friday’s hearing.\n\n“I don’t want to be glib about it, but the expense that Google might incur appears to be a drop in the bucket compared to the profits it reaps annually from the Play Store,” Donato said.\n\n"},

The military said dozens of projectiles were launched. Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu’s  office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea, though neither he nor his wife were home.\n\nThe barrage comes as Israel considers its expected response to an  Iranian attack earlier this month  and presses its offensives against Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIn Gaza, Israeli forces fired at hospitals in the battered northern part of the Palestinian enclave, and strikes in the strip killed more than 50 people, including children, in less than 24 hours, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press reporter there.\n\nIn September, Yemen’s Houthi rebels  launched a ballistic missile  toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahu’s plane was landing. The missile was intercepted.\n\nIn addition to the drone launched at Netanyahu’s private residence, Israel’s military said some 180 projectiles were fired throughout the day from Lebanon on Saturday morning. A 50-year-old man was killed after being hit by shrapnel while sitting in his car in northern Israel, and four people were injured, Israel’s medical services said.\n\nIn the northern city of Kiryat Ata, sirens blared as people ran for cover and intercepted missiles exploded in the sky. One rocket landed in the area, and Associated Press reporters saw burned cars and a damaged building. Itzik Billet, commander for the Haifa area, said nine people were lightly injured.\n\nThe Israeli fire service also said it was battling several blazes resulting from missiles in the Shlomi area, less than a mile (1 kilometre) from the Lebanese border.\n\nIsrael’s  war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah  — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was  killed in an Israeli airstrike  in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel’s military issued fresh evacuation warnings for two buildings in Beirut’s southern suburb of Haret Hriek. Israel has issued near-daily warnings for people to leave buildings and villages across parts of Lebanon. The fighting has displaced more than 1 million people, including some 400,000 children.\n\nIsrael also said Saturday it killed Hezbollah’s deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel.\n\nIn Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck.\n\nA standoff is also ensuing  between Israel and Hamas , which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signalling resistance to ending the war after the  death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar  this week.\n\nOn Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him.\n\n“Hamas is alive and will stay alive,” Khamenei said in his first comments on the killing.\n\nSince  Israel claimed Sinwar’s death Thursday ,  confirmed by a top Hamas official  Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages taken from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The staunch position pushed back against a statement by Netanyahu that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released, and will  remain in Gaza  to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming.\n\nSinwar was the chief architect of the 2023 Hamas raid on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel’s retaliatory  offensive in Gaza  has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.\n\nMore strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital’s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff.\n\nAt Al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, strikes hit the building’s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. Three houses in Jabaliya were struck overnight Friday, killing at least 30 people, more than half of them women and children, said Fares Abu Hamza, head of the health ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. At least 80 people were injured.\n\nIn central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, the same hospital said. Associated Press journalists counted the bodies from both strikes at the hospital.\n\nA United Nations school sheltering displaced people in the west of Gaza City, was also hit, killing several people, according to the Hamas-run civil defense first responders.\n\nThe strikes knocked out internet networks in northern Gaza, said Paltel, the Palestinian communications company, on Facebook Saturday.\n\nThe war  has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza , displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, and left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel.\n\nSinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the war in Gaza even as Israel presses its  offensive against Hezbollah  with ground troops in southern Lebanon and  airstrikes in other areas  of the country.\n\nIsrael has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority.

There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead.\n\n\n\n"},

But he felt uneasy when his guidance counsellor set up a meeting for Tait to tell his family.\n\nHis parents were supportive. His mom’s ex-husband, whom they lived with at the time, was not, leading to four years of emotional abuse that manifested in alcoholism, drug misuse and a suicide attempt.\n\n“He kicked me out right after I was discharged from the psych ward,” said Tait, 24.\n\nOn Thursday, Saskatchewan Party Leader Scott Moe said banning “biological boys” from sharing change rooms with “biological girls” would be his party’s  first order of business if it’s re-elected  on Oct. 28.\n\nTait is one of many LGBTQ+ advocates who say the campaign promise is hateful and puts transgender youth at risk.\n\n“If this legislation had existed when I was a kid, I would not have survived high school and that’s the fact of the matter,” he said. “School was my one safe space, the only place where I felt I could be authentic.”\n\nMoe has said the promise for a change room policy came in response to a complaint that two biological males had changed for gym class with girls at a school in southeast Saskatchewan.\n\nNDP Leader Carla Beck accused Moe of stoking fear and division with voters and making vulnerable kids more at risk.\n\nMoe’s promise also comes one year after the Saskatchewan Party government passed a law requiring parental consent for children under 16 to use different names or pronouns at school.\n\nBeck told reporters this week her party would repeal the law if it wins the provincial election, a move Moe said would take away parents’ rights to be involved in their children’s lives and allow teachers to “keep secrets from parents.”\n\nMost kids don’t want to hide from their parents, Tait said, but those who do typically have a reason.\n\n“It is entirely out of safety and safety concerns,” he said. “It’s a rare story, but it’s a story that still happens.\n\n“It’s a harmful narrative to say that kids want to hide from their parents and it’s a harmful narrative to say that schools are keeping things from parents purposefully.”\n\nHeather Kuttai, the mother of a gender-diverse child and a former commissioner with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission, said Moe is targeting transgender children to bring in voters because they are an “easy target.”\n\n“He did it before, and he’s just doing it again,” she said. “It’s a direct attack on the rights of trans adults and children.\n\n“When they hear this kind of rhetoric, even just the talking about it, it’s harmful. It sounds hateful and mean, like you’re not valued, like you don’t matter.”\n\nPrince Albert Pride posted on social media that organizers feel “saddened, fearful and frustrated” by the proposed change room directive and that the group was not consulted.\n\nIt said transgender youth are being treated as “political pawns.”\n\n“Forcing trans girls to change with teenage boys will not keep anyone safe,” it said.\n\n“It will put trans and two-spirit youth in harm’s way, and at greater risk of assault, sexual assault and bullying.”\n\nTait said a change room policy is a distraction from real election issues like health care, and it could have a long-lasting impact on gender-diverse youth and their ability to exist “in their most authentic form,” Tait said.\n\n“(We) need queer and trans folks,” said Tait.\n\n“We bring light, we bring joy. And to me, it feels like we have a government that is trying to erase us.”\n\n"},

That represents a 6.4 per cent increase compared with last year’s planned spending.\n\nInflation,  which has cooled to 1.6 per cent , is the key driver of why Canadians anticipate spending more this holiday season, experts say, as polling shows many have creative plans to rein in their shopping.\n\nBarry Choi, a personal finance expert at Money We Have, said even though inflation is down, prices are still up compared with previous years.\n\n“I think we’ll see more people being tighter with their budgets and capping how much they’re spending on gifts,” he told Global News in an interview.\n\nFinancial pressures are going to continue affecting holiday shopping this year and despite inflation coming down, that won’t necessarily “ease the consciousness of the consumer,” said Marty Weintraub, national retail leader at Deloitte Canada.\n\nA quarter (26 per cent) of Canadians surveyed by NerdWallet in September said they will be giving gifts to fewer people this year due to inflation and a third (34 per cent) said they will be spending less per person compared with past years.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot more flexibility, I think, in the way that people are approaching the holiday shopping,” said Shannon Terrell, lead writer and spokesperson for NerdWallet Canada.\n\nSurveys show that Canadians will be turning to gift cards, coupons, cashback sites, loyalty programs, rewards points and even second-hand items when shopping for themselves or others.\n\n“It would not surprise me if more people shopped the secondary market to get unique gifts at a good price,” Choi said.\n\nMore than a quarter (28 per cent) of Canadians said in a  survey conducted by Givex  last month that they plan to spend at least $200 or more on gifts cards this holiday season – up from 20 per cent last year.\n\nGift cards are more popular among older Canadians, with millennials, gen X and baby boomers ranking them as their top or second-most-common thing to gift,  a PwC Canada survey showed .\n\nChoi said gift cards can often be a good solution for people struggling with choices.\n\n“Purchasing gift cards is an easy way to manage your budget and keep the stress of holiday shopping down,” he said.\n\nTerrell said the popularity of gift cards has a lot to do with the rise of online shopping.\n\n“Sometimes giving a gift card or an e-gift card that can be sent electronically, it’s convenient for the person purchasing the gift, but it’s also convenient for the person who receives it.”\n\nYounger generations are leaning into flexible gift-giving strategies, Terrell said, with gen Z and millennial shoppers more likely to opt for different types of gifts that are more affordable.\n\nWith the  “underconsumption core”  trend taking social media by storm in recent months, Terrell said many people might even go for DIY-homemade gifts and prioritize shared experiences over material things.\n\nThe PwC poll found that 28 per cent will buy second-hand or refurbished products to stretch their holiday budget further.\n\nTo trim expenses, self-giving where people buy something for themselves is also going down, Weintraub said.\n\nThere are several ways that shoppers can avoid breaking the bank when shopping for the holidays.\n\nChoi said that “setting a hard budget,” whether that be the total budget or a per person budget, is the way to go, as well as trimming back on how many people gifts are being bought for.\n\nDeals apps, like Flipp, can come in handy to help compare prices between different retailers, he said.\n\nTiming your holiday shopping can also help and Choi advises starting during Black Friday so people can make the most of good deals.\n\nThis year’s Black Friday is expected to be one of the busiest simply because of the search for value and wanting to stretch dollars, Weintraub said. On top of that there are five fewer shopping days between Black Friday and Christmas, which puts more pressure on retailers and consumers, he said.\n\n“There’ll be a real big battleground in retail, online and in stores for those dollars in those precious days between Black Friday and Christmas.”\n\nTerrell said starting early can spread the holiday spending over multiple months and help capitalize on potential sales or deals.\n\nMaking a list is helpful to avoid splurging or overspending, she said. And for people who collect credit card rewards, now may be the ideal time of the year to redeem them to “really help take away some of the sting from those raised holiday prices.”\n\nOnline marketplaces and even social media channels are good options if you’re looking for both value and convenience, Weintraub said.\n\nBut at the end of the day, “we don’t need to sacrifice our financial well-being for the sake of holiday shopping or travel,” Terrell said.\n\n“If you need to scale back or omit the gift exchange entirely, perhaps now is the time to say so, because a friend or family member may be in the same position as you,” she added.\n\n"},

It is common in long COVID patients.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10818663/dysautonomia-awareness-month-long-covid/", "article": "Medical researchers at the University of Calgary say a condition affecting autonomic bodily processes — those that occur automatically, such as heart rate, bladder function and sweating — is frequently found in people diagnosed with long COVID.\n\nThe condition is known as dysautonomia, an umbrella term for a group of related conditions. Support networks for those who suffer from it are working to raise awareness throughout October, which has been deemed  Dysautonomia Awareness Month  by the advocacy group, Dysautonomia International.\n\nAccording to research by Dr. Satish Raj, a cardiologist and expert in autonomic health conditions at the University of Calgary, as many as 30 per cent of  long COVID  patients also meet the criteria for a condition called POTS, a form of dysautonomia known as “postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.”\n\nAccording to Dysautonomia International, other studies have put the figure at between 70 per cent and 90 per cent.\n\nThe challenge is that the symptoms of the condition can be easy to dismiss. “Who likes to sit around and talk about their sweating,” notes Dr. Raj. “No one does that… These are just the background things that are useful for keeping you alive.”\n\nRashmin Hira, a PhD student at the Universty of Calgary and long COVID researcher, adds, “Unfortunately, a lot of people do get told that it’s just anxiety.”\n\nThat’s why raising awareness through events such as Dysautonomia Month are important, says Lauren Stiles, president and CEO of Dysautonomia International.\n\n“(It) is one way that we help people get diagnosed faster,” Stiles says. “It’s also really important to raise awareness so that we can interest government and investors and other people to fund research in this group of diseases.”\n\nWhen it comes to POTS, symptoms can include lightheadedness, nausea, blood pooling and a high heart rate. The most common treatments include increase intake of fluids and salt and, if possible, recumbent exercise.\n\nBut even if the symptoms and treatment of POTS appear subtle, it is nothing to take lightly, Stiles says. Thirty per cent of people with the condition rely on a wheelchair to get around and many others are unable to work.\n\n“There are millions of people who really, really suffer from autonomic disorders,” Stiles says. “We want to build support and compassion for these patients in their communities so that they can get access to the resources that they need.”\n\nDysautonomia International is encouraging those who want to show support during the awareness month to share information with friends and family, participate in events, raise funds and wear a turquoise scarf.\n\n"},

There should be very, very little maintenance to an aluminum gangway like that, but we’ll see what the investigation unfolds,” Georgia Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Walter Rabon said at a news conference.\n\nThe gangway was installed in 2021, authorities said.\n\nRabon said three people remained hospitalized in critical condition from Saturday’s collapse.\n\nRabon said “upwards of 40 people” were on the gangway when the “catastrophic failure” occurred, and at least 20 people fell into the water. The gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another dock onshore.\n\nNone of the seven people killed were residents of the island, Rabon said. Eight people were taken to hospitals, at least six of them were initially reported Saturday to have critical injuries.\n\nThe ferry dock was rebuilt after Georgia officials in October 2020 settled a federal lawsuit by residents of the tiny community of Hogg Hummock, who complained the state-operated ferry boats and docks they rely upon to travel between Sapelo Island the mainland failed to meet federal accessibility standards for people with disabilities.\n\nThe state agreed to demolish and replace outdated docks while upgrading ferry boats to accommodate people in wheelchairs and those with impaired hearing. The state also paid a cash settlement of US$750,000.\n\nCrews from the U.S. Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others searched the water, according to Natural Resources spokesperson Tyler Jones. The agency operates the dock and ferry boats that transport people between the island and the mainland.\n\nA team of engineers and construction specialists were on site early Sunday to begin investigating why the walkway failed, Jones said.\n\n“There was no collision” with a boat or anything else, Jones said. “The thing just collapsed. We don’t know why.”\n\nHelicopters and boats with side-scanning sonar were used in the search, according to a Department of Natural Resources statement.\n\nAmong the dead was a chaplain for the state agency, Jones said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said federal officials were ready to provide any assistance needed.\n\nSapelo Island is about 97 kilometers south of Savannah, reachable from the mainland by boat.\n\nThe deadly collapse happened as island residents, family members and tourists gathered for Cultural Day, an annual fall event spotlighting Hogg Hummock, home to a few dozen Black residents. The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded after the Civil War by former slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding.\n\nHogg Hummock’s slave descendants are extremely close, having been “bonded by family, bonded by history and bonded by struggle,” said Roger Lotson, the only Black member of the McIntosh County Board of Commissioners. His district includes Sapelo Island.\n\n“Everyone is family, and everyone knows each other,” Lotson said. “In any tragedy, especially like this, they are all one. They’re all united. They all feel the same pain and the same hurt.”\n\nSmall communities descended from enslaved island populations in the South — known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia — are scattered along the coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage, from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing and basket-weaving.\n\nIn 1996, Hogg Hummock, also known as Hog Hammock, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, the official list of the United States’ treasured historic sites.\n\nBut the community’s population has been shrinking for decades, and some families have sold their land to outsiders who built vacation homes.\n\nTax increases and zoning changes by the local government in McIntosh County have been met by protests and lawsuits by Hogg Hummock residents and landowners. They have been battling for the past year to undo zoning changes approved by county commissioners in September 2023 that doubled the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock.\n\nResidents say they fear larger homes will lead to tax increases that could force them to sell land that their families have held for generations.\n\n"},
{"title": "How to protect yourself from scams", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhether it's romance scams or job scams, cybersecurity experts provide tips on how you can avoid falling pry to scammers.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10819932/how-to-avoid-scams-2/", "article": "NEW YORK (AP) — October isCybersecurityAwareness Month, which means it’s the perfect time to learn how to protect yourself from scams.\n\n“Scams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.\n\nAs scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, consumers should be more vigilant about who they trust, especially online. A quick way to remember what to do when you think you’re getting scammed is to think about the three S’s, said Alissa Abdullah, also known as Dr. Jay, Mastercard’s deputy chief security officer\n\n“Stay suspicious, stop for a second (and think about it) and stay protected,” she said.\n\nWhether it’s romance scams or job scams, impersonators are looking for ways to trick you into giving them money or sharing your personal information. Here’s what to know:\n\nThree common   tactics used by scammers   are based on fear, urgency and money, said security expert Petros Efstathopoulos. Here’s how they work:\n\n— Fear\n\nWhen a scammer contacts you via phone or email, they use language that makes it seem like there is a problem that you need to solve. For example, a scammer contacts you over email telling you that your tax return has an error and if you don’t fix it you’ll get in trouble.\n\n— Emergency\n\nBecause scammers are good at creating a sense of urgency, people tend to rush, which makes them vulnerable. Scammers often tell people they need to act right away, which can lead to them sharing private information such as their Social Security numbers.\n\n— Money\n\nScammers use money as bait, Efstathopoulos said. They might impersonate tax professionals or the IRS saying you will get a bigger tax refund than you expect if you pay them for their services or share your personal information.\n\nSimply being aware of typical scams can help, experts say. Robocalls in particular frequently target vulnerable individuals like seniors, people with disabilities, and people with debt.\n\n“If you get a robocall out of the blue paying a recorded message trying to get you to buy something, just hang up,” said James Lee, chief operating officer at the Identity Theft Resource Center. “Same goes for texts — anytime you get them from a number you don’t know asking you to pay, wire, or click on something suspicious.”\n\nLee urges consumers to hang up and call the company or institution in question at an official number.\n\nScammers will also often imitate someone in authority, such as a tax or debt collector. They might pretend to be a loved one calling to request immediate financial assistance for lease, legal help, or a hospital bill.\n\n\n\n So-called “romance scams”   ​​often target lonely and isolated individuals, according to Will Maxson, assistant director of the Division of Marketing Practices at the FTC. These scams can take place over longer periods of time — even years.\n\nKate Kleinart, 70, who lost tens of thousands to a romance scam over several months, said to be vigilant if a new Facebook friend is exceptionally good-looking, asks you to download WhatsApp to communicate, attempts to isolate you from friends and family, and/or gets romantic very quickly.\n\n“If you’re seeing that picture of a very handsome person, ask someone younger in your life — a child, a grandchild, a niece or a nephew — to help you reverse-image search or identify the photo,” she said.\n\nShe said the man in pictures she received was a plastic surgeon from Spain whose photos have been stolen and used by scammers.\n\nKleinart had also been living under lockdown during the early pandemic when she got the initial friend request, and the companionship and communication meant a lot to her while she was cut off from family. When the scam fell apart, she missed the relationship even more than the savings.\n\n“Losing the love was worse than losing the money,” she said.\n\n\n\nJob scams involve a person pretending to be a recruiter or a company in order to steal money or information from a job seeker.\n\nScammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.\n\n“They’re going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,” she said. “And they’re often saying it’s a 100% remote position because that’s so appealing to people.”\n\nSome scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver’s license details.\n\nThe only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.\n\nOther details don’t generally need to be shared with an employer until after you’ve gotten an offer.\n\n\n\nAccording to Lois Greisman, an associate director of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission,   an investment scam   constitutes any get-rich-quick scheme that lures targets via social media accounts or online ads.\n\nInvestment scammers typically add different forms of “testimony,” such as from other social media accounts, to support that the “investment” works. Many of these also involve cryptocurrency. To avoid falling for these frauds, the FTC recommends independently researching the company — especially by searching the company’s name along with terms like “review” or “scam.”\n\n\n\nWhen you’re using Facebook or scrolling Google results, be aware of   quiz scams  , which typically appear innocent and ask about topics you might be interested in, such as your car or favorite TV show. They may also ask you to take a personality test.\n\nDespite these benign-seeming questions, scammers can then use the personal information you share to respond to security questions from your accounts or hack your social media to send malware links to your contacts.\n\nTo protect your personal information,   the FTC simply recommends steering clear of online quizzes  . The commission also advises consumers to use random answers for security questions.\n\n“Asked to enter your mother’s maiden name? Say it’s something else: Parmesan or another word you’ll remember,” advises Terri Miller, consumer education specialist at the FTC. “This way, scammers won’t be able to use information they find to steal your identity.”\n\n\n\nWhen  buying or selling products  on Instagram or Facebook Marketplace, keep in mind that not everyone that reaches out to you has the best intentions.\n\nTo avoid being scammed when selling via an online platform, the FTC recommends checking buyers’ profiles, not sharing any codes sent to your phone or email, and avoiding accepting online payments from unknown persons.\n\nLikewise, when  buying something from an online marketplace , make sure to diligently research the seller. Take a look at whether the profile is verified, what kind of reviews they have, and the terms and conditions of the purchase.\n\nScammers often reach out by phone, Ben Hoffman, Head of Strategy and Consumer Products at Fifth Third Bank recommends that you don’t pick up unknown incoming calls.\n\n“Banks don’t ask your for your password,” said Hoffman. If you believe your bank is trying to reach out, give them a call at a number listed on their website.\n\nThis makes it easier to know for sure that you’re not talking to a scammer. As a general rule, banks don’t often call unless there is suspicious activity on your account or if you previously contacted them about a problem.\n\nIf you receive many unknown calls that end up being scammers or robocalls, you can use tools available on your phone to block spam. Check here for how to do this on your  iPhone  and here for  Android .\n\nUse all of the technology at your disposal\n\nThere are many tools are your disposal that can be used to protect yourself from scammers online.\n\n— Use a password manager to ensure you’re utilizing a complex password that scammers can’t guess.\n\n— Regularly checking your credit report and bank statements is a good practice since it can help you identify if someone has been using your bank account without your knowledge.\n\n— Turn on multi-factor verification to make sure impersonators aren’t able to access your social media or bank accounts.\n\nWhen in doubt, call for help\n\nAs scams get more sophisticated, it’s difficult to know who to trust or if a person is actually real, or an impersonator. If you aren’t sure if a job recruiter is real or if your bank is actually asking your for information, find organizations that can help you, recommended Velasquez.\n\nOrganizations like the Identity Theft Protection Center and the AARP Fraud Watch Network offer free services for customers who need help identifying scams or knowing what to do if you’ve been a victim of a scam.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve taken all the necessary steps to protect yourself, you might want to help those around you. Whether you’re helping your grandparents to block unknown callers on their phones or sharing tips with your neighbors, talking with others about how to protect themselves from scams can be very effective.\n\n\n\nIf you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it’s good practice to report it on the   FTC’s website  .\n\n \n\n\n\n"},

He previously proposed a 10 per cent across-the-board tariff — pushing it upwards of 50 per cent in recent interviews.\n\n“To me the most beautiful word in the dictionary is ‘tariff’,” Trump said Tuesday.\n\nThe rhetoric rings alarm bells north of the border. More than 77 per cent of Canadian exports go to the U.S and 60 per cent of Canada’s gross-domestic product is derived from trade. \n\nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce earlier this month released a report suggesting Trump’s 10 per cent tariffs would reduce the size of the economy between 0.9 and one per cent, resulting in around $30 billion per year in economic costs. Things would be even worse if other countries retaliated with tariff walls of their own.\n\nTrump’s first administration demonstrated how vulnerable Canada is to America’s whims when the former president scrapped the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n\nNegotiation of CUSMA, commonly dubbed “the new NAFTA,” was a key test for Ottawa following Trump’s victory. \n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called the updated trilateral pact a “victory for all Canadians,” and experts say it was more moderate than Trump originally threatened. \n\nBut Trump’s trade representative Robert Lighthizer critically recounted the renegotiation, writing in his book that at one point “NAFTA was hanging on by a thread.”\n\n“With Trump in charge he’s definitely a very volatile individual,” said Laura Dawson, an expert on Canada-U. S. relations and the executive director of the Future Borders Coalition.\n\n“And his affect global stability and security and international relations with the United States are going to be significant — and not in a good way.”\n\nCanada has taken lessons from his first presidency. Trump followed a fairly orthodox Republican trade agenda punctuated by explosive bursts of personal attention, Dawson said. He handed most responsibility for the trade relationship to a more predictable Lighthizer.\n\nAlec Beck, chairman of the fifth congressional district for the Republican party of Minnesota, said he believes talks about Trump as an isolationist are overstated. Beck, whose state shares an 885-kilometre border with Canada, said both countries must work together and tariffs are a bad idea.\n\n“They might feel good but it’s a sugar high,” the Republican said earlier this month.\n\nIf Harris wins, there will be more normal relations based on established patterns and rules, said Aaron Ettinger, a politics professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nIt’s expected the vice-president will follow the path laid by President Joe Biden, which brought some stability but not much change. He largely kept Trump’s tariffs in place, despite promises to reverse them.\n\nBiden also signed an executive order to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL, which would have transferred oil from Alberta to Nebraska.\n\nDawson said she expects a Harris administration would continue nationalist and protectionist actions. \n\nHarris has campaigned on returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. It is a great slogan and bumper sticker, Dawson said, “but it’s terrible if you are Canada.”\n\nThe impact of these policies on Canada-U. S. relations might not be clear to voters, who get behind the America first slogans.\n\nJeremy Washington says he believes electing the Republican presidential candidate would help both countries. The 27-year-old, who was at a recent Trump rally in Butler, Pa., said change is needed “because the things that have ruined … America have also affected Canada, like unfettered immigration, high housing prices, the currency seeming like its worthless.”\n\nExperts have warned the trade and tariff threats will also bring costs for Americans.\n\nDawson cautioned Trudeau’s team during a cabinet retreat in August that no matter who wins the U.S. presidency, Canada will have to work harder to maintain existing benefits of integrated trade and travel. \n\nCanada will rely more on one-off lobbying and advocacy to get special treatment as both Republicans and Democrats move away from the security of historical trade deals. \n\nExperts and business groups have been sounding the alarm about Canada’s changing role to its closest ally. Many say the relationship between the two countries shifted from being strategic to transactional as Canada became less critical compared with other places in the world.\n\nA report from the independent Expert Group on Canada-U. S. Relations, which includes former diplomats, policy advisers and business leaders, warned Ottawa was “sleepwalking” ahead of the 2026 trade pact review.

So anyway, you’re welcome,” the Tesla founder said as he handed Dreher the cheque.\n\nMusk has said he’s aiming to get at least one million signatures on his PAC’s petition. It is not known how many signatures the petition currently has.\n\nHowever, some experts are raising questions around the legality of Musk’s million-dollar giveaways.\n\nAs  reported by the BBC , election law expert and UCLA professor Rick Hasen wrote on his personal blog that he believes the tactic is “ clearly illegal ,” because federal law states anyone who “pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting” faces a potential $10,000 fine or five year prison sentence.\n\n“And who can sign the petitions? Only registered voters in swing states, which is what makes it illegal,” Hasen wrote.\n\nHasen told NBC News on Sunday that Musk’s PAC is only offering the payments to registered voters, not the general public at large, which is what  could make the scheme illegal .\n\n“Essentially what you’re doing is you are creating a lottery. You’re creating a lottery where the only people eligible to participate in the lottery are people who register to vote, or are registered to vote, and that’s illegal,” Hasen said.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also raised his concerns about the strategy on NBC News’ .\n\n“Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views. He’s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t. Obviously we have a difference of opinion,” Shapiro, a Democrat, said, adding: “I don’t deny him that, right, but when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it  raises serious questions .”\n\nMusk began holding a  series of solo events in support of Trump  for president this week, encouraging voters in Pennsylvania to register to cast their ballots and vote early – although he’s faced skepticism and pushback from the crowds.\n\nTrump for years has sowed doubt about mail and early voting by claiming it was rife with fraud, though voter fraud is rare in the United States. This year, Republicans are making a renewed push to encourage their supporters to vote early and lock in their ballots, though they acknowledge skepticism from those conditioned by Trump’s false claims.\n\nSaturday’s event was the third in as many days in Pennsylvania, where Musk is painting November’s election in stark terms.\n\nHe said on Saturday that if Harris wins, it will be “ the last election ,” suggesting the U.S. will no longer exist.\n\nHe also said the two assassination attempts against Trump prove he is ruffling feathers and upending the status quo in ways Harris won’t. He said that’s why no one is trying to kill Harris.\n\n“Assassinating a puppet is worthless,” Musk said, reiterating an argument he has made in a social media post.\n\n— \n\n"},

Here's how economists view the odds of another rate cut, and how much the policy rate could drop.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10818503/bank-of-canada-october-rate-cut-possibilites/", "article": "After proceeding at a tentative, 25-basis-point cut pace in the first three  interest rate  cuts of its cycle, many economists expect the  Bank of Canada  will take an oversized step lower in its upcoming decision on Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank’s policy rate stands at 4.25 per cent following the most recent quarter-point cut in early September.\n\nBut a lot’s changed in Canada’s economy since that time.\n\nFor one, inflation’s looking to be well-tamed, dropping from a bull’s eye on the Bank of Canada’s two per cent target to  1.6 per cent in the latest reading .\n\nTiff Macklem, governor of the central bank, has made clear in recent speeches that the Bank of Canada is equally concerned about inflation dropping too low below two per cent as it is about price pressures holding too high.\n\nWhile Macklem had previously warned there could be “bumps” on the path back to the price stability target, inflation has come under control faster than the central bank first anticipated. Previous forecasts called for a return to two per cent inflation sometime in 2025.\n\nRandall Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Desjardins, tells Global News that he doesn’t see much further room for inflation to fall in the months ahead, with September’s sharp drop in gas prices unlikely to be repeated.\n\nBut Bartlett adds that the rest of the country’s economic output is also coming in weaker than the Bank of Canada expected.\n\nThe central bank’s most recent projections from July had real gross domestic product rebounding to 2.8 per cent in the third quarter of the year; actual results are tracking closer to 1.5 per cent, according to Desjardins’ analysis.\n\nAnd outside of  solid job gains in the most recent report for September , Canada’s labour market has also shown cracks through the summer, with the unemployment rate rising briefly to a seven-year high outside the pandemic.\n\n“The unemployment rate is still pretty elevated and the trend is not the Bank’s friend. It seems to be moving gradually higher over time, despite some wiggles,” Bartlett says.\n\nHopes for any rapid improvement in the economic outlook have also been soured by the Bank of Canada’s own quarterly surveys tracking consumer and business sentiment, both of which showed little sign of a return to spending on the horizon.\n\n“We think all of this adds together … to suggest that a 50-basis-point rate cut is probably in the cards next week,” Bartlett says.\n\nSuch a scenario would mark the first time in more than 15 years that the Bank of Canada cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, outside the pandemic years.\n\nDesjardins was among early forecasters calling for a half-point cut in October, but they’re far from the only ones.\n\nEconomists from big banks including Scotiabank, RBC, CIBC and BMO have pencilled in an oversized step this week. TD Bank’s senior economist James Orlando acknowledged the growing case for a half-point cut in a note to clients, but argued that signs of resilience elsewhere in the labour market warrant another quarter-point move from the central bank.\n\nAs of Friday, Reuters said currency swap markets were pricing in an over 76 per cent chance of a 50-basis-point cut and another 25-basis-point reduction in December.\n\nCIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld even upped the ante in a note to clients last Friday.\n\nWhile he maintained CIBC’s call is for a 50-basis-point drop on Wednesday, he argued that a 75-basis-point “mega-move” could be on the table as well.\n\nWith the belief that there will be at least 75 basis points of easing in the policy rate between now and the end of the year, Shenfeld argued the Bank of Canada may frontload its cuts to get ahead of the curve.\n\nThere’s precedence for such movements, he noted, harkening back to the central bank’s 100-basis-point hike back in July 2022, when monetary policymakers were rapidly tightening to get decades-high inflation back under control.\n\nMovements in the United States could be what pushes the Bank of Canada to stick to 50 basis points, however, Shenfeld said in counter to his own argument.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off its easing cycle in September with an oversized half-point cut of its own. Macklem has maintained that the governing council sets its policy rate based on conditions north of the border, though too wide a gap in rates between the Bank of Canada and the Fed can hurt the Canadian dollar’s exchange rate, potentially exacerbating inflation on U.S. imports.\n\nBartlett notes that while the Bank of Canada is “justified” in cutting by half a percentage point based on domestic factors, the Fed’s big step and further cuts from other central banks around the world do “open the door” for Macklem and his compatriots to follow suit.\n\nBut recent strong economic data from the U.S. has scaled back expectations about the pace of easing from the Fed, Shenfeld noted. If the Bank of Canada is looking to avoid spooking financial markets with a larger, 75-basis-point move, it could keep to the already priced-in 50 basis points, he said.\n\nIt’s not just the Fed’s easing cycle that will have the Bank of Canada looking south of the border in the months ahead.\n\nThe outcome of the U.S. presidential election will weigh heavily on the Canadian economy, and by extension, the Bank of Canada’s rate path, Bartlett says.\n\nA  Desjardins analysis from earlier this month  anticipates a sharper decline in economic activity for both Canada and the U.S. in the event of a second Donald Trump presidency, rather than a Kamala Harris victory. Trump has threatened to levy blanket tariffs on imports to the U.S., a move that would depress Canada’s hopes for an economic rebound and could trigger a recession in the worst-case scenario.\n\n“The Bank of Canada will need to bring that in, both in terms of what the tariff impacts are going to be in the Canadian economy, but also weaker overall U.S. economic activity … and what the spillovers are to the Canadian economy,” Bartlett says.\n\nWhile such a move could hasten the Bank of Canada’s rate cuts in a bid to gird the economy, Bartlett notes it could be some time before the policies from a possible second Trump term filter through to the central bank’s outlook.\n\nThe Bank of Canada would adjust its forecasts when specific policies are announced, he says, and are therefore unlikely to be factored in until the April monetary policy report — a few months into the new president’s tenure.\n\nFor the Bank of Canada’s final rate decision of the year in December, Bartlett argues the debate will likely be between 25 and 50 basis points once more, where more “sluggish” economic activity in the months ahead would point to the need for a steeper cut.\n\n\n\n"},

This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there, they said, ‘Oh my God, that’s unbelievable.'”\n\nHe laughed before continuing: “I had to say. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold as a man.”\n\nDespite the odd choice of topic, one of Palmer’s daughters, Peg Palmer Wears, said she was unconcerned by the comments about her dad. \n\n“There’s nothing much to say. I’m not really upset,” she told The Associated Press in an interview on Sunday. “I think it was a poor choice of approaches to remembering my father, but what are you going to do?” \n\nThe Harris campaign, however, quickly seized on the former president’s off-colour comments.\n\nSarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, asked on X if anyone had “ done a wellness check” on Trump .\n\nhas someone done a wellness check on  @realDonaldTrump   https://t.co/5pQVWgfDJ0 \n\n— Sarafina Chitika (@SarafinaChitika)  October 19, 2024 \n\n\n\nThe Harris campaign also highlighted the comments, sharing a clip from Fox News, where the host recapped  Trump’s attention to detail .\n\nFox host: After our interview, Donald Trump flew to Pennsylvania where he discussed the size of Arnold Palmer’s manhood  pic.twitter.com/B5Sg13lwW9 \n\n— Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ)  October 20, 2024 \n\n\n\nWhen CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Speaker Mike Johnson about why Trump was talking about Palmer’s genitals and whether that is the message Trump wants to share with voters in the dwindling days of his campaign, Johnson dodged the question.\n\nIt wasn’t until he was pressed on Trump’s acuity, and again asked why there were comments at a rally about Palmer’s manhood, that Johnson answered.\n\n“Jake, you seem to like that line a lot,” Johnson said to Tapper.\n\nTapper interjected, saying, “I don’t want to be talking about this, right?

When President Trump is at a rally, sometimes he’ll speak for two straight hours. You’re questioning his stamina, his mental acuity, Joe Biden couldn’t do that for five minutes,” Johnson said.\n\nTrump also took time in Latrobe to escalate his personal attacks on Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, calling her a “s— vice president.”\n\n“Bernie is radical left, and this one, Kamala, is further left,” Trump told the cheering crowd at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport. “And then, so you have to tell Kamala Harris that you’ve had enough, that you just can’t take it anymore. We can’t stand you. You’re a s— vice president.”\n\nHe then channeled his most famous catchphrase from his days on : “The worst. You’re the worst vice president. Kamala, you’re fired!

They come as his lawyers tried again Monday to get him freed on bail — and complained that a “fresh wave of publicity” is endangering his right to a fair criminal trial.\n\nIn the lawsuits filed Sunday in state and federal courts, four men and three women, all anonymous, allege they were sexually assaulted by Combs at parties over the last two decades.\n\nCombs, 54, has pleaded not guilty to  federal sex trafficking charges  contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.\n\nHe has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nCombs’ lawyers asked a judge Sunday to order potential witnesses and their lawyers to stop making statements that could prevent a fair trial.\n\n“As the Court is aware, Mr. Combs has been the target of an unending stream of allegations by prospective witnesses and their counsel in the press,” they wrote. “These prospective witnesses and their lawyers have made numerous inflammatory extrajudicial statements aimed at assassinating Mr. Combs’s character in the press.”\n\nThe latest lawsuits are drawn from what lawyers say are  more than 100 accusers  who are planning legal action against Combs. Plaintiffs’ lawyer Tony Buzbee announced the planned litigation at an Oct. 1 news conference and posted a 1-800 number for accusers to call.\n\nAs before, Combs’ representatives dismissed the latest lawsuits as “clear attempts to garner publicity.” They said Combs and his legal team “have full confidence in the facts, their legal defences, and the integrity of the judicial process.”\n\nCombs “has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman,” they added.\n\nOne of the lawsuits filed Sunday alleges that a 13-year-old girl who was invited to a party by a limousine driver after the Video Music Awards in Manhattan in September 2000 was raped by a “male celebrity” and then by Combs as individuals identified only as “Celebrity A,” a male, and “Celebrity B,” a female, watched.\n\nAnother lawsuit alleged that Combs sexually assaulted a 17-year-old male at a Manhattan hotel penthouse party in 2022.\n\nIn the lawsuits, it was alleged that the plaintiffs believed they had been fed drinks laced with drugs before they were assaulted.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Combs on Monday told the 2nd Circuit in a filing that he’ll renew his bail application before the lower court based on “significant changed circumstances.” They said the issues include “constitutional concerns stemming from his conditions of confinement and evidence contained in recently produced discovery.”\n\nIn a filing last week, prosecutors told the appeals court that judges denied bail after evidence showed Combs “used methodical and sophisticated means to silence and intimidate witnesses throughout the racketeering conspiracy and during the Government’s investigation.”\n\n—\n\n"},

But the new rule would expand that coverage, allowing millions to buy condoms, birth control pills, or “morning after” pills from local storefronts for free without a prescription.\n\nThe proposal comes days before Election Day, as Vice President Kamala Harris affixes her presidential campaign to a promise of expanding women’s health care access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to undo nationwide abortion rights two years ago. Harris has sought to craft a distinct contrast from her Republican challenger, Donald Trump, who appointed some of the judges who issued that ruling.\n\n“The proposed rule we announce today would expand access to birth control at no additional cost for millions of consumers,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “Bottom line: women should have control over their personal health care decisions. And issuers and providers have an obligation to comply with the law.”\n\nThe emergency contraceptives that people on private insurance would be able to access without costs include levonorgestrel, a pill that needs to be taken immediately after sex to prevent pregnancy and is more commonly known by the brand name “Plan B.”\n\nWithout a doctor’s prescription, women may pay as much as $50 for a pack of the pills. And women who delay buying the medication in order to get a doctor’s prescription might jeopardize the pill’s effectiveness, since it is most likely to prevent a pregnancy within 72 hours after sex.\n\nIf implemented, the new rule would also require insurers to fully bear the cost of the once-a-day Opill, a new over-the-counter birth control pill that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved last year. A one-month supply of the pills costs $20.\n\nCopays prevent some women from purchasing birth control, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that praised the newly proposed rule.\n\n“Birth control is a critical part of so many of our patients’ lives, but the simple truth is that even with insurance coverage, the cost of copays can be prohibitive for many people,” the statement said.\n\nFederal mandates for private health insurance to cover contraceptive care were first introduced with the Affordable Care Act, which required plans to pick up the cost of FDA-approved birth control that had been prescribed by a doctor as a preventative service.\n\nAmerica’s Health Insurance Plans, the lobbying group for private health insurers, said Monday it was reviewing the proposal.\n\nThe proposed rule would not impact those on Medicaid, the insurance program for the poorest Americans. States are largely left to design their own rules around Medicaid coverage for contraception, and few cover over-the-counter methods like Plan B or condoms.\n\n"},

Once Barrett is healthy, he will immediately slot into the Raptors’ starting lineup.\n\n“It’s tough, especially for a team like us,” said centre Jakob Poeltl, who missed the final 32 games of last season after he had surgery to repair his left pinky finger. “We haven’t played together for very long, like the starters played a little bit together last year,\n\n“We’ve got so many new faces, the more practice and games we can get in together, the better.”\n\nBarrett, from Mississauga, Ont., has been out with a sprained shoulder since the Raptors’ first pre-season game on Oct. 6. Rookie combo guard Ja’Kobe Walter, who missed the entire pre-season, is also out with a sprained shoulder.\n\nHead coach Darko Rajakovic said Walter also practised on Monday, but the 19th overall pick in last summer’s NBA Draft is considered week-to-week.\n\nVeteran forward Bruce Brown (arthroscopic knee surgery) was active on Monday, doing shooting drills with coaching staff at OVO Athletic Centre. Kelly Olynyk (back) of Kamloops, B.C., did not participate.\n\n“It hurts us that we have a few guys out, but I’d rather have it happen now than during the regular season,” said Poeltl. “So let’s hope everybody stays healthy for the rest of the season.”\n\nBarrett’s upgraded status came days after point guard Immanuel Quickley returned to Toronto’s starting lineup on Friday in Brooklyn after he missed the first four pre-season games with a sprained thumb.\n\n“We missed him out during the pre-season,” said Poeltl of Quickley. “He’s our offensive floor general. He spaces the floor really well.\n\n“(We) worked a lot in the summertime on our little two-man game, so it’s too bad we didn’t get to try it in the pre-season. We’re going to have to go all-in with it in the regular season.”\n\nToronto finished the pre-season with a 3-2 record, including impressive wins over the NBA champion Boston Celtics and Brooklyn last week to close out the exhibition period.\n\nThe Raptors averaged 113.2 points per game in the pre-season, 10th best in the NBA. They had a league-best 31.4 assists per game, and were sixth-best with 48.6 rebounds per game. All three stats are improvements on the numbers from last season’s disappointing 25-57 campaign.\n\nBut those stats — and any exhibition numbers — should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nKey Toronto players like Scottie Barnes, Barrett, Quickley, Brown, and Olynyk missed some or all of the pre-season, and the same could be said for their opponents. Rajakovic was pragmatic about the raft of injuries, suggesting that the Raptors didn’t rush anyone back.\n\n“We’ve got to take the approach one game at a time and really be focused on that next day and next practice and next team,” he said. “We are looking at the long-term interest of the team and long-term interest of the players.\n\n“We want players to be healthy and available for a long run, not just necessarily for one game or the other.”\n\nMONSTER MASH — After Toronto’s 116-112 victory in Brooklyn to close out the pre-season the Raptors took the weekend off. That gave them the time to have the team’s annual Halloween party. The consensus was that technology lead Brandon Moita’s Darth Maul costume stole the show.\n\n“We had a great party. Guys had a lot of fun. It was another great event for everybody to come together,” said Rajakovic, who dressed as Peaky Blinders leader Thomas Shelby. ” (Moita) had the best costume. It was really impressive.”\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 21, 2024.\n\n"},

What to know about the narrow vote", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe “No” vote had looked to be ahead in the referendum right until the last few thousand votes were counted from the country’s large diaspora.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10821935/moldova-european-union-eu-referendum/", "article": "Moldovans voted by a razor-thin majority in favor of securing the country’s path toward  European Union  membership, electoral data showed Monday, following a ballot that nearly caused a major setback for the pro-Western president, who accused “criminal groups” of trying to undermine the vote.\n\nWith 99.41% of the 1.4 million votes counted in the  EU  referendum held Sunday, the “Yes” vote stood at 50.39%, to 49.61% who voted “No,” according to the Central Electoral Commission.\n\nThe “No” vote had looked to be ahead right until the last few thousand votes were counted from the country’s large diaspora. A loss would have been a political disaster for the pro-Western government, which strongly supported the pro-EU campaign.\n\nOn Monday, President Maia Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the votes, calling it a “vile attack” on Moldova’s sovereignty.\n\n“Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote rigging and corruption,” she told a news conference. “Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.”\n\nMoldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a “hybrid war” campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme.\n\nIn Brussels, the European Union’s executive branch, the European Commission, said that its services had also noted Russian interference in Moldova, and it underlined its continued support for Moldova on its EU accession path.\n\n“This vote took place under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes in the Republic of Moldova,” spokesperson Peter Stano said.\n\nStano told reporters that allegations of vote buying, the bussing of voters and disinformation are only the most recent forms of Russian interference, and that attempts to undermine Moldova and its support for the EU have been going on for months.\n\nIn the presidential race that was held at the same time, Sandu won the first round with 42% of the vote in a field of 11, but failed to win an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26% of the vote, in a runoff on Nov. 3.\n\nBy the time polling stations closed at 9 p.m. Sunday, more than 1.5 million voters — about 51% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission.\n\nCristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that earlier polls might have “overestimated the pro-EU feeling” inside Moldova and the referendum would have failed to pass without votes from outside the country.\n\n“It’s going to be particularly problematic because … it’s going to feed into narratives that are pushed by the Kremlin and pro-Russian forces,” he said.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby echoed Russian interference concerns this week, saying in a statement that “Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration.” Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova.\n\nIn early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots.\n\nShor was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying the payments were legal and citing a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned.\n\nOn Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended “more advanced training in guerrilla camps” in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days.\n\nA pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year.\n\nMoldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations.\n\n"},
{"title": "Pregnancy and coffee: A cup of joe may not be as risky as you think", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDrinking coffee during pregnancy may not be as risky as once thought, according to a study that found no strong link between caffeine and neurodevelopmental problems in children.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10821784/pregnancy-coffee-caffeine-child-neurodevelopment/", "article": "Drinking  coffee  during  pregnancy  may not be as risky as once thought, according to a recent study that found no strong link between caffeine consumption and neurodevelopmental problems in children.\n\nDespite these reassuring findings, the researchers still recommend that pregnant people stick to medical advice on caffeine limits.\n\nThe observational study, published Oct. 9 in , suggested that drinking a moderate amount of coffee during pregnancy is unlikely to have a significant effect on a child’s brain development.\n\n“Our analysis found no link between coffee consumption during pregnancy and children’s neurodevelopmental difficulties,” said co-author Gunn-Helen Moen, from the University of Queensland’s Institute for Molecular Bioscience.\n\n“Overall, our study supports current clinical guidelines that state low to moderate consumption of coffee during pregnancy is safe for the mother and developing baby,” Moen said in an  accompanying commentary article on Oct. 14 .\n\nThese findings echo the advice from the  Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) , which states drinking caffeine while pregnant is safe in small amounts.\n\nThe current PHAC guidelines recommend keeping caffeine intake below 300 milligrams a day, which amounts to around two cups of coffee. This includes coffee, tea (including black, oolong, white and green tea), caffeinated soft drinks (cola beverages) and energy drinks, chocolate and herbs such as guarana and yerba mate.\n\n HealthLinkBC  also states that small amounts of caffeine are safe for the fetus. It’s recommended to keep caffeine intake below 300 mg per day, as higher levels of caffeine may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, it stated.\n\n“There are no studies to show that it has a detrimental effect on the fetus. And I generally say one to one to two cups per day is fine,” explained Dr. Lynn Murphy-Kaulbeck, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC).\n\nShe noted that some studies suggest high caffeine intake very early in pregnancy — equivalent to six, seven, or eight cups a day — may be a risk factor for miscarriage. But that is in high amounts.\n\nPrior  studies have  suggested increased coffee consumption during pregnancy is associated with the child having neurodevelopmental difficulties, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nThis is because caffeine and its main byproducts (paraxanthine, theophylline and theobromine) can easily pass through the placenta to the fetus. And because the fetus does not yet have fully developed enzymes to break down caffeine, the concern has long been that it could potentially accumulate in the system and negatively affect the developing fetal brain.\n\nCoffee and caffeine consumption are often linked with other factors like age, smoking and alcohol use, which may not have been accurately considered in previous studies about fetal development risks.\n\nBecause of this researchers then aimed to find out whether coffee was the actual cause of these risks or if other factors were involved.\n\nTo do this, the study looked at tens of thousands of families registered in  the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study . All pregnant women in Norway between 1999 and 2008 were invited to participate and 58,694 women took part with their child.\n\n“Scandinavians are some of the biggest coffee consumers in the world, drinking at least four cups a day, with little stigma about drinking coffee during pregnancy,” Moen said in a media release.  “Our study used genetic data from mothers, fathers and babies as well as questionnaires about the parents’ coffee consumption before and during pregnancy.\n\nParents were asked about their coffee consumption before and during pregnancy, as well as their child’s neurodevelopmental traits from six months to eight years of age. The participants also provided genetic samples, which enabled researchers to control for genetic variants shared between mothers and children, allowing for a clearer analysis of the effects of coffee drinking, the study stated.\n\nWithout adjusting for potential confounding factors such as maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, and parental education and income, the researchers found a link between higher maternal coffee consumption and various neurodevelopmental difficulties in offspring.\n\nHowever, after accounting for potential confounding factors, the previously significant effects of maternal coffee consumption on neurodevelopmental problems in offspring diminished to nearly zero.\n\n“Our MR analyses found little evidence for a causal effect between maternal coffee consumption and most offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties,” the study concluded.\n\nThe researchers concluded there were limitations to the study, as it was only able to rule out strong effects on neurodevelopmental difficulties, and it is possible small effects may exist. Coffee consumption during pregnancy could impact others and children in other ways.\n\nThe study also emphasized the need for additional research on this topic to gain a better understanding of how maternal coffee consumption impacts child development. However, in the meantime, the researchers said that low to moderate consumption of coffee during pregnancy is safe for the mother and developing baby.\n\n“I think women need to hear that’s OK to drink a coffee while pregnant,” Murphy-Kaulbeck said. “They don’t need to worry; in fact, they should enjoy it.”\n\n"},
{"title": "Central Park Five members sue Donald Trump for defamation over debate remark", "description": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn 1989, Donald Trump took out large newspaper ads calling for New York City to reinstate the death penalty for the Central Park Five teenagers. \t\t\t\t\t\t", "link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10822063/central-park-five-donald-trump-lawsuit-defamation/", "article": "Members of the  Central Park Five  have filed a lawsuit against former U.S. president  Donald Trump  for “false, misleading and defamatory” statements he made about the group during the presidential debate last month.\n\nDuring the Sept. 10 debate in Pennsylvania, Trump said the five men pleaded guilty and “admitted” to the brutal assault and rape of a woman who was attacked while running through Central Park in New York City in 1989.\n\n“They admitted — they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately,” Trump said on the debate stage. “And if they pled guilty — then they pled we’re not guilty.”\n\nThe jogger, Trisha Meili, survived the attack and did not die.\n\nDespite Trump’s insistence, the five men — Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise — never pleaded guilty to the charges against them. Even after they were convicted in a trial, all five men, who are Black and Latino, maintained their innocence.\n\nThey were cleared of all wrongdoing in 2002 when the charges were overturned after the real attacker, a convicted serial rapist, confessed to the crime. DNA evidence helped prove the Central Park Five’s innocence after they’d each already served several years in prison.\n\nThe group of men has since opted to be called “the Exonerated Five.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on Monday. The five men, all now in their 50s, called Trump’s comments “ demonstrably false ” and said they “suffered injuries” as a result of Trump’s defamatory statements.\n\nLawyers for the group called Trump’s remarks “extreme and outrageous” and said they were “intended to cause severe emotional distress” to the five men. They are seeking an unspecified amount of financial compensation for defamation and “severe emotional distress and reputational damage.”\n\nShanin Specter, a lawyer representing the Central Park Five, on Monday expressed regret that “the civil justice system doesn’t permit us to require Mr. Trump to apologize or retract his statement.”\n\n“The most that we can obtain are money damages both to compensate these five men for Mr. Trump’s damaging their reputations and for punishment of Mr. Trump for making these statements,” he said in a release.\n\nSpecter said the Central Park Five and their legal counsel “are not holding our breath” waiting for a Trump apology.\n\nAt the time the Central Park Five were charged in 1989 (when they were teenagers), Trump was publicly vocal about the case. As a real estate mogul, Trump took out large newspaper ads calling for the city to reinstate the death penalty.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, called the filing “just another frivolous, Election Interference lawsuit.” Cheung called the Central Park Five “desperate left-wing activists” and said the lawsuit was filed “to distract the American people from Kamala Harris’s dangerously liberal agenda and failing campaign.”\n\nLawyers for the Central Park Five noted in the filing that Salaam, a New York City Council member, attended the presidential debate, but was not in the room when Trump made the remarks.\n\nSalaam attempted to  confront  Trump about the comments in the spin room after the debate, where journalists conduct interviews. He was filmed repeatedly shouting questions to the Republican nominee about whether Trump would “apologize to the Exonerated Five.”\n\nTrump, from the podium, replied, “Ah, you’re on my side then.”\n\nSalaam was quick to respond, “No, no, no, I’m not on your side.”\n\nIn August, four members of the Central Park Five attended the Democratic National Convention and stood on stage. McCray was not among them.\n\nWise told the crowd, “Every day, as we walked into the courtroom, people screamed at us and threatened us because of Donald Trump.”\n\n“He spent US$85,000 on a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for our execution,” Wise said. “We were innocent kids, but we served a total of 41 years in prison.”\n\nSalaam also spoke on stage at the DNC and said, “45 wanted us unalive,” referring to Trump as the 45th president of the United States.\n\n“That man thinks that hate is the animating force in America. It is not,” Salaam said. “We have the constitutional right to vote; in fact, it is a human right. So, let us use it. I want you to walk with us. I want you to march with us. I want you to vote with us.”\n\nThe Central Park Five were wrongfully convicted following a high-profile trial in 1990. They said police coerced four of them into providing false confessions.\n\nIn 2014, officials representing New York City approved a US$41 million (C$56.7 million) settlement for the five men.\n\nThe case of the Central Park Five has since become culturally synonymous with heightened racial tensions in the U.S. in the ’80s and ’90s.\n\n"}
